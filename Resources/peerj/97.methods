This study was approved by both KEMRI and CDC ethical committees. Written informed consent in the local dialect was obtained for specimen collection. Specimens were collected as part of a study to provide baseline data for assessing the direct and indirect impact of introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on carriage of pneumococci. After obtaining informed consent, nasopharyngeal specimens (NPs) were collected using calcium alginate swab (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA) at Lwak Mission Hospital in Rarieda District in western Kenya or Tabitha Clinic in Kibera within Nairobi, Kenya during October&#x2013;December 2009 from 237 healthy children less than 5 years of age (C-NPs). NP swab and oropharyngeal swab specimens (OPs) were collected from 158 consenting adults (A-NPs and A-OPs) at Lwak; of these, 118 (75%) were tested as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive and 40 tested negative for HIV (The design of the carriage survey purposefully oversampled HIV-positive adults). For permanent storage, the individual NP and OP swabs were placed in separate storage/transport vials containing 1.0 ml milk-tryptone-glucose-glycerol (STGG) medium (), maintained on wet ice for up to 4 h, and frozen at &#x2212;70C. Before freezing, NP-STGG and OP-STGG specimens were vortexed for 10 s to disperse organisms from the swab. All NP-STGG and OP-STGG specimens were sent on dry ice to the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI-CDC) in Kisumu for pneumococcal isolation and for storage.Pneumococcal isolation from all NP-STGG and OP-STGG specimens was performed at KEMRI as previously described (). Briefly, supplemented Todd-Hewitt broth (STHB) consisted of 5 ml of Todd-Hewitt broth containing 0.5% yeast extract combined with 1 ml of rabbit serum. After a brief complete thawing and vigorous 10 s vortexing of the NP-STGG and OP-STGG specimens, 200-&#xB5;l aliquots from children NP-STGG specimens were added to 6 ml STHB. These specimens from children will be referred to as C-NPs. For adults, NP-STGG (200 &#xB5;l) and OP-STGG (200 &#xB5;l) aliquots from the same individual were inoculated simultaneously into 6 ml STHB; these combined specimens from adults will be referred to as A-NP/OPs. The C-NPs and A-NP/OPs were incubated for 6 h at 37&#xB0;C in a CO incubator prior to streaking onto blood agar plates. One milliliter aliquots of the incubated A-NP/OPs and C-NPs were frozen for subsequent DNA extraction, cmPCR for 40 serotypes or serogroups, and real time  PCR at Atlanta-CDC as previously described (, see  for latest updates).Immediately after the 6 h incubation, 10 &#xB5;l from the A-NP/OPs and C-NPs were streaked onto a blood agar plate at KEMRI-CDC. After incubation at 37&#xB0;C in a CO incubator for 18&#x2013;24 h, alpha-hemolytic colonies (one picked from each colony morphology ()) were subcultured and subsequently tested for optochin susceptibility and bile solubility under CO atmosphere as described (). Only one colony that represented each colony morphology was picked for pneumococcal identification and serotyping, since we have found no improvement in detecting mixed pneumococcal carriage through picking colonies that share identical appearance (). Pneumococcal&#x2013;positive (optochin-sensitive or bile soluble) isolates recovered at KEMRI-CDC were sent to Atlanta-CDC for serotyping with CDC antisera, which is used to resolve 92 different serotypes, including serotypes 6C and 6D (; ).Subsequent to the work described above, the original STGG-NPs and STGG-OPs from children and adults were shipped to Atlanta-CDC for isolation/characterization of cmPCR-positive non-pneumococcal species, and for comparison of pneumococcal isolation and cmPCR analysis from a subset of the 158 matched adult specimens (56 STGG-NPs and 56 STGG-OPs) after performing broth-enrichment in STHB as described above in phase 1. Isolated non-pneumococcal strains were also subjected to cmPCR and the real time  PCR assays as previously described (; ).cmPCR amplicons from either bacterial isolates or preculture broth extracts were sequenced employing cmPCR primers and the Big Dye V1.1 dideoxy sequencing kit (ABI) on an ABI-3100 sequencer. Reference amplicon sequence coordinates from GenBank accessions are provided at . The 47 amplicon sequences from this study that do not exactly match the relevant reference sequences are provided in . cmPCR sequence subtypes encountered in this study that were not previously documented in the public GenBank were designated as subject number targeted serotype or serogroup. For example, cmPCR sequence subtype 300.2 corresponds to adult subject 300 and a positive cmPCR amplicon for serotype 2 exactly matching in length with the reference cmPCR amplicon referred to in the CDC cmPCR primer list (, primer sequences, GenBank accessions and base coordinates are included in this list). Similarly, 300.10 refers to a cmPCR amplicon sequence corresponding to serogroup 10F/10C/33C. Designations that share complete sequence identity to the indicated GenBank accession over the described base coordinates of the pneumococcal reference sequence are preceded by &#x201C;st&#x201D; and the pneumococcal serotype without any reference to the specimen number. For example, st14.14, st10F.10, st3.3 all represent sequence identity within amplicon overlaps with sequences previously documented in GenBank that were derived from pneumococci of the indicated serotypes.Multilocus amplification/sequencing and nearest species matches were determined at  for each cmPCR-positive non-pneumococcal isolate by multilocus sequence analysis as described (). This site automatically concatenates 7 entered housekeeping locus sequences (, 426 bp; , 351 bp; , 552 bp; , 492 bp; , 516 bp; , 378 bp; , 426 bp) in order to compare a 3063 bp sequence with the online species database (). A dendrogram of the 9 concatenated 3063 bp sequences, together with corresponding concatenates from two pneumococcal strains, was constructed using the Wisconsin Package (Wisconsin Package, version 10.3 Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) Distances program with the neighbor-joining approach and the un-corrected distance model.Specific information pertaining to individual specimens (of the 237 C-NPs and 158 A-NP/OPs described) is available upon request. This also includes the 56 NP-STGG and 56 OP-STGG adult specimens that were cross-compared to original combined co-cultured results. Sequence subtypes of cmPCR amplicons shorter than 200 bp are included within  (due to current GenBank policy barring their inclusion). GenBank accessions KC771356&#x2013;KC771416 represent all additional cmPCR amplicon sequences &gt;200 bp in length from this study except for those noted as being already documented within GenBank. All housekeeping locus sequences were deposited in GenBank with accessions KC808157&#x2013;KC808165 and KC779228&#x2013;KC779254.
