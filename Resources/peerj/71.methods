This study considered the mainland of South Korea, excluding some smaller islands, such as Ulleung, and Dokdo. The area is approximately 100,000 km, lies between 33.931&#xB0;N and 38.705&#xB0;N and 125.436&#xB0;E and 129.705&#xB0;E. Korea is located in the humid temperate climatic zone, affected by the influence of both continental and oceanic air masses. National mean annual rainfall is 1,300 mm, ranging from 1000 mm (Daegu area) to 1,800 mm (Jeju area). Approximately half of the annual rainfall occurs during the summer months, June to August, with occasional typhoons. During the summer, although the ambient temperature is high (mean temperature; 20&#x2013;25&#xB0;C), and crop canopies are thick, the precipitation exceeds the potential evapotranspiration because of concentrated heavy rainfall. As a result, the base saturation ratios in the majority of soils are rather low. Temperatures in the spring and autumn are mild (mean temperatures of 10&#x2013;15&#xB0;C) and winter months are rather cold (monthly mean temperature of &#x2212;5&#x2013;2&#xB0;C), particularly in the central and northern regions. In the winter, spring and autumn, the precipitation is less than in the summer. Despite these seasonal differences, the amount of precipitation and the potential evapotranspiration remain similar year round because of the lower ambient temperatures in the drier seasons.Korea is a mountainous country. More than two-thirds of the country is occupied by mountains with steep slopes. Plains are subdivided into inland plains, coastal plains and the plains in the narrow valleys. The plains had been under intensive use for agricultural production. The high relief of the land coupled with the heavy downfalls of rain in the summer affects the characteristics of Korean soil very profoundly. Soil erosion has been intense throughout the country for a long time, particularly where the population density is high.The parent materials of Korean soils are part of the ten recognised geologic systems from different geological time series. Dominant rock types include granitic gneiss (32.4%), granite (22.3%), schist (10.3%), limestone of the Chosun series (Cambrian-Ordovician; 10.1%). The former three geological systems are present in about 60% of the land area and are known as acidic rocks. The fact that the rainfall exceeds the potential evapotranspiration and coupled with the abundance of acidic rocks, results in the wide occurrence of acidic soils in the country. The limestones of the Chosun series are alkaline, thus the soils derived from these rocks tend to be neutral or slightly alkaline. These soils are only found near Kangwon Province. Some areas contain sandstone bedrock which results in coarse-textured soils. However, even among the soils derived from the same parent rock, the textures can vary depending upon the location in the soil catena. Soils developed in high elevation areas tend to be coarse due to severe loss of fine particles by erosion, while the soils developed at the locations where soil erosion is not severe tend to be fine-textured. Given, the high variation of soil as function of climate, topography, parent materials and landuse, it is a challenge to produce estimates of soil properties at a fine resolution.The soil survey was initiated by the Korean Rural Development Agency (RDA), UN, and FAO with a reconnaissance survey, making use of aerial photographs purchased from USA funded by Korea Soil Survey Organization between 1964 and 1967. As a result, soil maps of Korea at scales of 1:250,000 and 1:50,000 were published. Thereafter, RDA adopted the US Soil Taxonomy system and carried out the detailed soil survey between 1968 and 1990 alone. Now, detailed soil maps (1:25,000) are available for entire country in both hard copies and digital format. Furthermore, RDA prepared highly detailed soil maps (1:5,000) between 1995 and 1999 for the entire country. These were digitized and made available for the public through the RDA web site ().The soil database used in this study was compiled based on the soil profiles in &#x201C;Taxonomical Classification of Korean Soils&#x201D; (), which were mostly collected in the 1970s. It includes soil profile descriptions along with physical and chemical analysis for the modal profiles of the 380 soil series defined in South Korea. Soil chemical and physical properties of each horizon ( = 1, 559) were recorded, including particle size distribution, moisture retention, organic matter content (OM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and a limited number of bulk density (BD) data. Soil water retention was recorded for water content at &#x2212;10, &#x2212;33 and &#x2212;1500 kPa on the mass basis ( in g 100 g) using soils that were ground and sieved to &lt;2 mm. The statistics of the data is given in the . The data show a wide range of distribution for bulk density and water retention. The low bulk density and high water retention soils are due to the Andisols, while the high bulk density and low water retention soils are due to Entisols which have a high sand content (&gt;70%).A couple of problems arise in using this database to map the AWC: Not all soil samples have measured bulk density and  at &#x2212;10 and &#x2212;1500 kPa. Thus they need to be predicted using pedotransfer functionsWater content () at &#x2212;10 kPa in the database was measured using disturbed (ground) samples. Thus a correction factor is needed to take into account the effect of bulk density.
            Only 108 samples contain measured BD, so first we derived a linear model predicting bulk density as a function of organic matter (OM) and sand content. While this model has a reasonable predictive capacity ( = 0.59), when we applied this model to the whole datasets, we obtained unreasonable estimates of values between &#x2212;2.00 to 2.50 g cm. Therefore we used a more conceptual function as proposed by  which first estimated the mineral bulk density, BD as a function of sand content and soil depth. This estimate is then combined with the BD model of  which incorporated the effect of organic matter (OM). Andisols which contain a high amount of allophanic materials can have a different response to the model. Therefore we derived a separate model for BD for Andisols using a global dataset ().Available water capacity is defined here as the amount of water held by the soil between field capacity and wilting point. Water content at field capacity is usually measured in laboratory at a potential of &#x2212;10 or &#x2212;33 kPa. Here we use water content at &#x2212;10 kPa to represent field capacity, and at &#x2212;1500 kPa for wilting point. Although field capacity is more of a dynamic property which depends on the soil&#x2019;s hydraulic conductivity (), because of the unavailability of field measurement, we only used the laboratory data.In the absence of laboratory measurement, water content at field capacity can be predicted using pedotransfer functions from the soil&#x2019;s particle size distribution, and bulk density or soil structural information (; ). Here we developed a linear regression model predicting gravimetric water content at &#x2212;10 kPa () and &#x2212;1500 kPa () measured on ground soil samples using basic soil information: clay content, sand content, organic matter content (OM) and cation exchange capacity (CEC): 
            Water content at field capacity is affected by macroporosity and soil structure (), and therefore measurement is recommended using natural soil clods. Meanwhile water content at wilting point or &#x2212;1500 kPa is not much affected by structure, as most water is held with adsorptive forces, thus it can be measured using disturbed soil samples (). However in the Korean soil database, water content at &#x2212;10 kPa was measured on ground samples. This is because the samples collected from soil survey were mainly for mapping and classification purposes, and samples for bulk density and soil clods were not collected. This problem is also common in other countries ().  warned against the use of field capacity data derived from disturbed samples as its measurement overestimates in-situ field capacity for most soils except for coarser textured soils.Thus water retention data in the Korean soil database which were measured on ground samples need to be adjusted to represent the likely water content at a given bulk density. To build such a model, the only publicly available data that contained such measurements is the soil characterization and profile data from the US National Soil Characterization database (). 301 samples in the database contained water content at &#x2212;10 kPa measured using both natural clods and disturbed samples. From this subset, 274 samples were selected for building the model and the rest (27 samples) were used as validation data. The data are from 141 profiles, and the samples come from A, B and C horizons from various depths in the top 2 m of the profile.The statistics of the soil properties from the US database is given in . The database contained measurements of , the percent mass of water retained at suction of 10 kPa, which was measured on natural fabric (clods), and reported on a &lt;2 mm base.  is the gravimetric water content of air dry &lt;2 mm (ground) samples, after equilibration at 10 kPa suction. BD is the bulk density (g cm) of the &lt;2 mm fraction, with volume being measured after equilibration at &#x2212;10 kPa. We used a linear regression to obtain the estimates of  from  plus other basic soil properties.After adjustment of water retention at &#x2212;10 kPa for bulk density, available water capacity for each layer is calculated as the difference in volumetric water content (&#x3B8;) between field capacity and wilting point, adjusted by gravel content:  where volumetric water content (&#x3B8; in percent volume) is calculated from gravimetric water content (percent mass) multiplied by bulk density (in g cm):  is the volume fraction of gravel (m m), calculated from :  where  is the mass fraction of gravel (kg kg), and  is the ratio of soil to gravel density (BD/2.65). The PAWC (profile available water capacity in mm) is calculated as the sum for all the layers up to 100 mm:  The procedure for estimation of PAWC is summarised in .Procedure for estimation and mapping of profile available water capacity (PAWC) in Korea.The map of the available water capacity to 1 m depth (PAWC) was made by calculating the modal PAWC value for each of the South Korean soil series. The modal values for each soil series were then allocated to each of the map units of the 1:25,000 map. An equal-area spline was utilised to represent the continuous soil depth function of AWC. The equal-area spline function not only fits the water content data with depth, but also disaggregates data obtained from horizon bulk samples into a continuous depth distribution. The spline function consists of a set of local quadratic functions tied together with &#x2018;knots&#x2019; that describe a smooth curve through a set of points. These functions are advantageous for harmonizing soil properties that were collected at different depths. See  for the mathematical detail of the functions.An independent dataset was used to validate the map predictions. The map validation dataset comprises measurement from 170 soil profiles representing 165 soil series. These profiles were collected recently in 2009 and 2011. As the samples were collected for soil survey purposes, no water retention measurement was made, however the data contains measurement of particle size analysis (850 samples) and bulk density (570 samples). We can therefore validate the maps of bulk density, clay and sand content. These variables are the important predictors of available water capacity. The validation was performed on 5 standard depths where the soil samples were measured: 0&#x2013;5, 5&#x2013;15, 15&#x2013;30, 30&#x2013;60, and 60&#x2013;100 cm. The prediction from the map was resampled to these standard depths using the equal area spline function.To validate the prediction of water content at field capacity, another published dataset was used (; ). This dataset, here called water retention validation dataset, is a collection of 18 mostly topsoil (0&#x2013;20 cm) samples, representing 7 soil series. The samples were measured for soil hydraulic properties using an undisturbed soil core with the onestep outflow technique, and water content at &#x2212;10 kPa was calculated (see  for the description of the dataset).
