The use of peripheral blood specimens in this study was approved by a Stanford University IRB.VeraCode microbeads were provided by Illumina, Inc. (San Diego, CA) in microcentrifuge tubes, each containing approximately 40,000 beads in 70% ethanol. VeraCode microbeads are cylindrical glass beads measuring 240 microns in length by 28 microns in diameter. A digital holographic element containing a numeric code is embedded within the beads serving as a unique identifier. When excited by a laser, each bead emits a unique code image that is detected by Illumina&#x2019;s BeadXpress Reader System.Tubes containing the VeraCode microbeads were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at greater than or equal to 10,000 rpm. Most of the 70% ethanol was removed from the tubes, leaving &#x223C;150 &#xB5;L of residual 70% ethanol with the 40,000 beads. Subsequently, 200 &#xB5;L of peripheral blood was added to the 70% ethanol and bead mixture using a 1 mL pipet and mixed thoroughly. The peripheral blood specimens containing the bead mixtures were then extracted on the Qiagen BioRobot EZ1 Workstation using the EZ1 DNA Blood 350 &#xB5;L Kit (Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer&#x2019;s standard protocol with a 200 &#xB5;L elution volume. The eluate containing the VeraCode beads was transferred to the well of a 96-well round bottom microplate (Corning Inc., Corning, NY). A KingFisher 96 pin magnet head with a tip comb (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to remove residual Qiagen magnetic beads that could potentially interfere with the BeadXpress Reader System.On seven independent days, VeraCode microbeads were added to three peripheral blood specimens. As is outlined in , the same sets of peripheral blood specimens were used for two or three days. Following the extraction process described in the above section, the beads were transferred to a 76.2 &#xD7; 25.4 mm standard glass microscope slide and a 24 &#xD7; 50 mm cover glass was used. The VeraCode microbeads were counted using a microscope under 100 &#xD7; magnification.Six peripheral blood specimens submitted for cystic fibrosis gene mutation testing underwent DNA extraction as described above with and without VeraCode microbeads added to the peripheral blood; beads containing a unique bead identification code were added to each peripheral blood specimen. DNA eluates with and without the beads were tested with the Cystic Fibrosis Genotyping Assay (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). In brief, this assay detects 32 cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator () gene mutations via multiplex PCR amplification and oligonucleotide ligation assays followed by detection via capillary electrophoresis on an Applied Biosystems 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA). The resulting electropherograms were interpreted and evaluated for equivalency by two molecular pathologists (JDM and IS). A plate containing the residual DNA specimens with and without the beads was covered, frozen, and shipped to Illumina, Inc. to use the BeadXpress Reader System in order to determine the bead number associated with each specimen. We required that &#x2265; 20 beads with the same barcode be detected by the instrument for definitive specimen identification for all experiments. In internal experiments, Illumina has determined that the bead mis-identification rate is under 0.5%, suggesting that a requirement for 20 beads for sample identification is more than sufficient.We selected six independent peripheral blood specimens from individuals without a known cancer diagnosis, and for three of the specimens, we spiked in a cell line containing the - translocation at a 1:10,000 dilution to generate positive sensitivity controls near the lower limit of detection of the  translocation assay. DNA extraction was performed as described above with and without VeraCode microbeads added to each of the six peripheral blood specimens. Beads containing a unique bead identification code were added to each peripheral blood specimen. DNA eluates with and without the beads were tested with our assay used to detect - translocations involving the major breakpoint region, minor cluster region and intermediate cluster region of . This assay uses multiplex, nested PCR followed by detection of amplification products via agarose gel electrophoresis. The resulting gel photographs were interpreted and evaluated for equivalency by two molecular pathologists (JDM and IS). A plate containing the residual DNA specimens with and without the beads was covered, frozen, shipped to Illumina, Inc., and scanned on the BeadXpress Reader System in order to determine the unique bead identification code associated with each specimen. The group using the BeadXpress Reader System was blinded to which specimens had beads added and to which bead identification code was used in each sample.Three peripheral blood specimens were used for this portion of the study &#x2013; each was submitted to our molecular pathology laboratory for testing with either the Cystic Fibrosis Genotyping Assay described above, the quantitative  V617F MutaQuant assay (Ipsogen, Stamford, CT), or our laboratory-developed Fragile X syndrome assay. The  V617F MutaQuant assay is an allele-specific, real-time PCR assay that quantifies both  V617F and corresponding wild-type alleles. Our laboratory-developed Fragile X syndrome assay uses PCR optimized for GC-rich amplicons followed by capillary electrophoresis on an Applied Biosystems 3130xl Genetic Analyzer to detect (CGG) trinucleotide repeat expansions in the 5&#x2032; untranslated region of . Each specimen was assigned a unique bead identification code. Beads with this identification code were added to four aliquots of each peripheral blood specimen, and the specimens were extracted as described above. Eluates containing the beads were incubated at 25&#xB0;C. Two aliquots of each specimen were removed after 50 days and 90 days. Each specimen was re-tested using the same assay for which the specimen was originally submitted, and the results were interpreted and evaluated for equivalency by two molecular pathologists (JDM and IS). A plate containing the DNA specimens with beads was covered, frozen, and shipped to Illumina, Inc. to use the BeadXpress Reader System in order to determine the bead identification code associated with each specimen. The group using the BeadXpress Reader System was blinded to which bead identification code was added to each specimen.Accelerated stability calculations used the Q model, a simplification of the Arrhenius equation approach (). In this experiment, the method predicts the stability of a well-characterized reagent at &#x2264; 4&#xB0;C based on stability at the elevated temperature of 25&#xB0;C. The Q value equals 2. Under the Q model, the time relationship between the accelerated temperature (Taccel) and the storage temperature (Tstorage) is given by the equation Q Factor = 2; therefore, for this experiment the Q Factor = 2 = 4.3. One day at 25&#xB0;C is equivalent to &#x223C;4 days at 4&#xB0;C.
