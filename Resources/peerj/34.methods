Tomato ( cv. Glamour) plants were grown on 10&#xA0;cm diameter round pots containing potting soil (BM7) (Berger Co., Quebec, Canada) and maintained in the greenhouse under a 14-h light/10-h dark photoperiod at 23 &#xB1; 2 &#xB0;C. Four-week-old tomato plants were used for the experiments.  pv.  DC3000 and  pv.  T1 were used as virulence bacterial pathogens (host pathogens), and  pv.  and  pv.  were used as nonhost bacterial pathogens on tomato.These host and nonhost bacterial pathogens were grown overnight at 28 &#xB0;C in King&#x2019;s B (KB) medium [10&#xA0;g Proteose pepton #2 (BD Difco, New Jersey, USA); 1.5&#xA0;g anhydrous ; 15&#xA0;g glycerol; 5 mL  (1M sterile)] containing appropriate antibiotics (kanamycin 25 mg/ml and rifamycin 50 mg/ml). After the overnight culture, bacterial cells were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 10 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of sterile distilled water. The concentration of bacteria in the culture suspension was measured in a spectrophotometer (the optical density at OD 600 nm) and diluted to appropriate concentrations for inoculations.Bacterial suspensions (3&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;10&#xA0;colony forming unit [CFU]/ml) were prepared in sterile distilled water containing 0.025% Silwet L-77 (OSI Specialties Inc., Danbury, CT, USA) and sprayed on tomato plants. The inoculated plants were then incubated in growth chambers at 90 to 100% RH for the first 24 h. The inoculated plants were observed at 7 days post inoculation (dpi) for symptom development. Bacterial growth in leaves was measured by determining the internal bacterial population. Prior to sampling, leaves were surface-sterilized with 15% HO for 3 min to eliminate epiphytic bacteria and then washed with sterile distilled water. The leaves were then homogenized in sterile distilled water, and serial dilutions were plated onto KB medium containing antibiotics (kanamycin, 25&#xA0;mg/ml). The bacterial population at 0 dpi was estimated from leaves harvested 1&#xA0;h post inoculation (hpi). Bacterial growth patterns at 0, 1 and 3 dpi were evaluated in two independent experiments (four leaf samples per each experiment).The bacterial culture of  pv.  was centrifuged and resuspended in distilled water at a concentration of 5&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;10&#xA0;CFU/ml. For stomatal closure assay, the tomato epidermal peel was prepared as described (). Epidermis of tomato leaves were peeled off and immediately floated on stomata opening buffer (10 mM MES-KOH, 30 mM KCl, pH 6.3). After confirming stomata opening under the microscope, the epidermal peels were treated with  pv.  with or without COR (100 ng/ml; obtained from C. Bender, Oklahoma State University). Approximately 100 random stomatal apertures were measured per each treatment, and three samples were collected from each experiment.To determine if COR inhibits nonhost HR cell death, two nonhost bacterial pathogens,  pv.  and  pv.  were used for this experiment in tomato. Bacterial cultures grown in KB medium overnight at 28 &#xB0;C were centrifuged (3,500 rpm, 10 min) and resuspended in MES buffer (MES 10 mM, pH 6.5). The bacterial suspension was infiltrated into fully expanded tomato leaf using a 1.5 ml needleless syringe for examining bacterial growth and nonhost HR cell death. Three different concentrations (100, 200 and 300 ng/ml) of COR were tested to determine COR toxicity in tomatao leaves. Both 200 and 300 ng/ml showed visible cell death and chlorosis symptoms. The concentration of 100 ng/ml of COR was added to bacterial suspension (10 CFU/ml) to determine the inhibition of HR cell death. Infiltrated leaves were inspected for HR cell death after 24 h and 48 h inoculation. Tomato plants silenced for isochorismate synthase (ICS) accumulation by RNAi () () were also used to evaluate if COR inhibits SA accumulation and suppress HR cell death. To determine whether the bacterial growth is promoted by COR, a low concentration of  pv.  (2&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;10 CFU/ml) was inoculated with or without COR. The bacterial population in the apoplast was examined at 0, 1 and 3&#xA0;dpi.The detection of HO in leaf tissues was done by 3,3&#x2019;-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining. HO reacts with DAB to form a reddish-brown stain.  pv.  DC3000 and  pv.  were infiltrated into one side of the tomato leaf with or without COR (100 ng/ml; obtained from C. Bender, Oklahoma State University) (; )). The DAB staining procedure was followed as described ().Total RNA was purified from tomato leaves infiltrated with water (mock control), COR, nonhost pathogen  pv.  (),  with COR, or host pathogen  pv.  T1 ( T1). Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and two treated or inoculated leaves were pooled to represent one biological replicate. Total RNA was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen), and 1&#xA0;&#xB5;g RNA was used to generate cDNA using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo d(T)15&#x2013;20 primers. The cDNA (1&#xA0;:&#xA0;20) was then used for qRT-PCR using Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Primers specific for  was used to normalize small differences in template amounts. To determining COR-mediated inhibition of SA and JA hormonal pathway, real-time quantitative PCR was performed with primers shown in . Average Cycle Threshold (CT) values calculated using Sequence Detection Systems (version 2.2.2; Applied Biosystems) from duplicate samples were used to determine the fold expression relative to controls. All qRT-PCR were performed using ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) and calculation was made according to the company manual (User Bulletin #2).
