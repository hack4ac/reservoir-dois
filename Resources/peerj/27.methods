Sepharose 4BCL activated with cyanogen bromide (CNBr) were from GE Healthcare (Uppsala, Sweden). Dextran (Mr 1500, 6000), polyethyleneimine (PEI) (Mr 1500 kDa), 2-dipyridyldisulfide (2-PDS), diethyl-p-nitrophenylphosphate (D-pNP), dithiothreitol (DTT), L-aspartic acid, sodium borohydride, Triton X-100, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC), hydroxylamine hydrochloride, n-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), cysteine hydrochloride, ethylenediamine (EDA), thymidine, Dimethyl 3- phenylglutarate (), p-nitrophenylbutyrate (pNPB) () and -Succinimidyl--acetylthioacetate were from Sigma. Dextran-aldehyde, aspartic-dextran and amines-dextran prepared as previously described&#xA0;(; ). 3&#x2019;,5&#x2019;-di--acetylthymidine () was synthetized as previously described&#xA0;(). Other reagents and solvents used were of analytical or HPLC grade. lipase (Genkbank number X95309) mutants were prepared as previously described&#xA0;(). Briefly, all site-directed mutagenesis experiments were carried out by PCR using mutagenic primers (See ESI, ). To introduce the amino acid change, the corresponding pair of primers was used as homologous primer pair in a PCR reaction using a specific plasmid as a template and Prime Start HS Takara DNA polymerase. The product of the PCR was digested with endonuclease DpnI that exclusively restricts methylated DNA&#xA0;()  DH10B cells were transformed directly with the digested product. The plasmid with mutated BTL were identified by sequencing and then transformed into  BL21 (DE3) cells to express the corresponding proteins. Firstly, C65S was created, and the resulting plasmid was used as a template to create the double mutant C65S/C296S-BTL. This plasmid was used as a template to construct additional mutations (A193C, L230C) using different mutagenic primer&#xA0;().The gene corresponding to the mature lipase from  BTL was cloned into pT1 expression vector, as previously described&#xA0;(). Cells carrying the recombinant plasmid pT1BTL2 were grown at 30&#xA0;&#xB0;C and over expression were induced by raising the temperature to 42&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 20 h. The enzyme was purified from  crude extract by interfacial adsorption on Octyl-Sepharose as previously described (). The lipase was desorbed from the support adding 20 mL of 25 mM phosphate buffer pH 7 with 0.5% Triton X-100 (v/v) per gram of support. After that, the lipase was immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose at pH 7 in 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer for 1&#xA0;h at 25&#xA0;&#xB0;C (&#xA0;&gt;&#xA0;95% immobilization yields) with a final loading of .The activities of the soluble lipases (for the immobilization process) and their immobilized preparations were analyzed spectrophotometrically measuring the increment in absorbance at 348 nm produced by the release of p-nitrophenol (pNPOH) (&#x2208;&#xA0;=&#xA0;5.150&#xA0;M&#xA0;cm) in the hydrolysis of 0.4 mM pNPB in 25 mM sodium phosphate at pH 7 and 25&#xA0;&#xB0;C. To initialize the reaction, 0.05&#x2013;0.2 mL of lipase solution or suspension was added to 2.5 mL of substrate solution. Enzymatic activity is given as micromole of hydrolyzed pNPB per minute per milligram of enzyme (IU) under the conditions described above.To a 100 mL of dextran-aspartic polymer solution (10&#xA0;mg/mL) Mw. 1.500 in 5 mM sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.0 were added 16 and 9.6&#xA0;mg (0.125 eq) of EDC and NHS, respectively. Similar to before, to a 100 mL of dextran-aspartic polymer solution (10&#xA0;mg/mL) Mw. 6000 in 5 mM sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.0 were added 1.0 and 0.6&#xA0;mg (0.0313 eq) of EDC and NHS, respectively. For both polymers, the reaction was maintained for 2 h at 25 &#xB0;C. After that the mixture was then dialyzed 3 times against distilled water (300 volumes). Then, the pH of polymer solution was set at 7.5 in 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.5. Subsequently,  (0.0625 eq) or  (0.0156 eq) of a 100 mM cysteine solution were added to polymers of Mw 1.500 and 6.000, respectively. The reaction was maintained for 2 h at 25&#xA0;&#xB0;C and finally the mixture was extensively dialyzed (See ).Synthesis of tailor-made thiol-dextran polymers.To 100 mL of amine-dextran polymer solution (10&#xA0;mg/mL), Mw 1.500 or 6.000, in 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 was added  (0.0625 eq) or 26 (0.0156 eq)  of a solution 100 mM in acetonitrile of -Succinimidyl--acetylthioacetate, respectively. The reaction was maintained for 2 h at 25&#xA0;&#xB0;C and finally the mixture was extensively dialyzed. Finally, a solution of 100 mM hydroxylamine chloride in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5.5 was added to the polymers for 30 min for deacetylation (see ).Different BTL variants (0.2 g of the immobilized form) were incubated in 2 mL of DTT solution (50 mM in 25 mM sodium phosphate at pH 8) for 30 min to avoid oxidation and permitting the posterior disulfide exchange. After, the reduced biocatalysts were washed with distilled water after the DTT smell disappeared.Then 0.2 g of reduced BTL variants was added to 3 mL of 2-PDS solution (1.5 mM substrate in a mixture of DMSO (5%, v/v) in 25&#xA0;mM phosphate buffer at pH 8.0) for 1&#xA0;h. The cysteine PDS activation was followed spectrophotometrically by measuring the increase of the absorbance at 343 nm (by the release of 2-mercaptopyridine, which quickly tautomerizes into 2-thiopyridone) of the solution. A full modification was found in all BTL variants&#xA0;().0.7&#xA0;mL of respective polymer solution was dissolved in 2.3 mL of 500 mM sodium phosphate buffer with 0.5% Triton-X100 at pH 8. Then, 0.2 g of immobilized PDS-BTL variants was added. After 1 h, the modification was confirmed spectrophotometrically by measuring the increase of the absorbance at 343 nm. The biocatalyst was filtered.Substrate  (5 mM) was dissolved in a mixture of acetonitrile (5%, v/v) in 10 mM sodium phosphate at pH 7.0 or 10&#xA0;mM sodium acetate at pH 5.0. 0.2 g of biocatalyst was added to 2&#xA0;mL of this solution at 25&#xA0;&#xB0;C. During the reaction, the temperature and the pH value was maintained constant using a pH-stat Mettler Toledo DL50 graphic. The degree of hydrolysis was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC (Spectra Physic SP 100 coupled with an UV detector Spectra Physic SP 8450). For these assays a Kromasil C18 &#xA0;&#x3D5;&#xA0;(25&#xA0;cm&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;0.4&#xA0;cm) column was used and the following gradient program (A:&#xA0;mixture of acetonitrile (10%,&#xA0;v/v) in 10&#xA0;mM ammonium phosphate at pH 4.2; B:&#xA0;mixture of miliQ water (10%,&#xA0;v/v) in acetonitrile; method: 0&#x2013;6 min 100% A, 6&#x2013;14&#xA0;min 85% A&#x2013;15%&#xA0;B, 14&#x2013;22&#xA0;min 100% A, flow: ).

          The enantiomeric excess (ee) of the released monoester  was analyzed by chiral reverse phase HPLC. The column was a Chiracel OD-R, and the mobile phase was an isocratic mixture of acetonitrile (20%, v/v) in 10 mM ammonium phosphate at pH 3. The detection of the compounds was performed at 210 nm. The retention time was 58.7 min for ()- and 63.2 min for ()-.0.2 g of different BTL immobilized preparations were suspended in 4 mL of 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer solution at pH 7 and 25&#xA0;&#xB0;C with or without the presence of 0.5% of Triton X-100.
