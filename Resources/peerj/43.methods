The Delphi process involves a group of experts making private ratings of agreement with a series of statements, feedback to the group of a statistical summary of the ratings, and then another round of rating (). Statements about supporting tertiary students with a mental illness were derived from a search of the lay and scientific literature, and these were presented to a panel of experts in three sequential rounds. Any additional strategies suggested by panel members were included in the subsequent round for all experts to rate. A summary of group ratings was fed back to the panel members after the first two rounds. Panel members could choose to either change or maintain their ratings. In this way, a list of statements that had substantial consensus in ratings was developed, and those statements with low or conflicting ratings discarded.There were two separate panels, one comprising professionals in the field, include disability liaison unit staff, student counsellors, researchers on student mental health and administrators. The second panel consisted of consumer advocates, i.e.&#xA0;those with current or very recent (within the last 2&#xA0;years) experience of being a tertiary student with a mental health problem. Professionals were recruited through the Australian and New Zealand Student Services Association (ANZSSA) and through directly approaching student counselling and disability services. ANZSSA has members in 32 of the 39 universities in Australia and 10 of the 60 Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institutes. Participants were limited to Australian institutions due to differences in educational systems. Consumers were recruited by distributing information about the study to consumer organizations associated with mental health issues (including Bluevoices, the consumer forum of beyondblue: the national depression and anxiety initiative). Consumers were offered a voucher worth AUD25 for each round of the survey they completed. The study did not aim to get representative samples of experts, because the Delphi method requires panel members who are information and experience rich rather than representative.Panel membership numbered 109, with 74 professionals and 35 consumers. 81 panel members were female (66% of the professionals and 91% of the consumers). The median age was 49&#xA0;years for the professionals and 22&#xA0;years for the consumers. Of the 74 professionals on the panel, there were 24 disability and support services staff, 23 psychologists, 12 student counsellors, 7 mental health nurses, 7 mental health educators, 7 mental health academic staff, 2 social workers, 1 occupational therapist, and 1 medical practitioner (figures do not add up to 74 due to panel members reporting multiple roles).A systematic literature review was conducted of websites, books and journal articles for strategies about how institutions could support students with mental health problems. This involved a comprehensive search in Google search engines (, , , ). The following search terms were entered into each: &#x201C;tertiary education OR higher education OR vocational education OR college OR campus AND depression OR anxiety OR mental disorders OR psychiatric disability&#x201D;. The first 50 sites for each set of search terms were examined for statements about how institutions could support students with a mental illness. Any links that appeared on these web pages that the authors thought may contain useful information were followed. Relevant journal articles were located on PsycINFO and PubMed, using the search terms &#x201C;tertiary education&#x201D; OR university OR college AND student* AND &#x201C;mental disorder&#x201D; [Title/Abstract] OR &#x201C;mental illness&#x201D; [Title/Abstract] OR &#x201C;psychiatric disability&#x201D; AND policy OR procedures OR services.We obtained suggestions for how institutions could support students with a mental illness from 59 websites (50 tertiary education institution sites), 3 pamphlets and 21 journal articles. Suggestions were limited to &#x201C;actionable items&#x201D; &#x2013; actions that could be taken by tertiary institutions. Just over 80% of initially identified sources provided at least one suggestion for the initial questionnaire. The majority of strategies came from tertiary institution websites. In addition, the questionnaire content was informed by a small number of strategies suggested by the working group to fill perceived gaps in the questionnaire&#x2019;s content. One of the authors (AR) carried out the literature review, analysed the information gathered from these sources and wrote the suggestions up as individual survey items. This document was presented to a working group comprising the authors, who screened the items to ensure they fitted the definition of actions that tertiary institutions could take to support students with a mental illness, were comprehensible, and had a consistent format, while remaining as faithful as possible to the original wording of the information. After several draft surveys, the group produced a list of 172 items that formed the first survey sent to panel members.The Round 1 survey was organized into 9 sections (see ). Panel members were asked to rate the importance of each item. The rating scale used was: essential, important, depends, unimportant, should not be included, don&#x2019;t know. The Round 1 survey also included comment boxes that allowed panel members to give feedback after each section. To analyse the comments that panel members had written in the first round questionnaire, one of the authors (AR) read through all the comments and wrote them up as draft strategies. The working group evaluated the suggested draft strategies to determine whether they were original ideas that had not been included in the first round questionnaire. Any strategy that was judged by the group to be an original idea was included as a new item to be rated in the second round questionnaire. Panel members completed the questionnaires online using . The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Melbourne (Ethics ID: 1034964).Round 1 survey sections and number of items.On completion of each round, the survey responses were analysed by obtaining percentages for the professional and consumer panels for each item. The following cut-off points were used:
            If at least 80% of both the professional and consumer panels rated an item as essential or important as a guideline for institutions supporting students with a mental illness, it was included in the guidelines.
          Panel members to rerate an item in the next round if:
            80% or more of the panel members in one group rated an item as essential or important70&#x2013;79% of panel members in both groups rated an item as either essential or important
          Any items that did not meet the above conditions were excluded.
