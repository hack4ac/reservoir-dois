Isolated human skin samples obtained from elective plastic surgery procedures (32 pieces of skin fragments obtained by 4&#xA0;mm punch biopsies from 4 individuals; 3 females and a male aged 26&#x2013;74, average: 56.5; 3 skin samples were taken from the scalp and one was taken from the hip) were maintained in supplemented serum-free William&#x2019;s E medium as previously reported (; ; ; ). Human tissue collection and handling was performed according to Helsinki guidelines, after institutional review board ethics approval (University of Luebeck) and informed patient consent.Skin samples were first incubated overnight to adapt to culture conditions after which the medium was replaced and vehicle or test substances were added. For human skin organ culture, skin samples were treated with ACEA (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany, 30&#xA0;&#xB5;M) or AM251 (Sigma-Aldrich, 1&#xA0;&#xB5;M), or the combination of them for 1-day after the overnight incubation (). Following culturing for the time indicated, skin samples were cryoembedded and prepared for histology, immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence and quantitative immunohistomorphometry (; ; ). Each evaluation was performed on 2&#x2013;4 sections of 2 skin fragments per each treatment group from 2&#x2013;4 individuals.Human immortalized HaCaT KCs () were cultured in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and antibiotics (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria). For qRT-PCR, the cells were cultured with ACEA (1&#xA0;&#xB5;M) for 8&#xA0;h.qRT-PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems/Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA) using the 5&#x2019; nuclease assay as detailed in our previous reports (; ). Total RNA was isolated from HaCaT keratinocytes using TRIreagent (Applied Biosystems/Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA) and digested with recombinant RNase-free DNase-1 (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol. After isolation, one &#xB5;g of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA by using High Capacity cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol. PCR amplification was performed by using specific TaqMan primer and probes (Applied Biosystems, assay ID: Hs01699178_g1 for human K6A). As internal housekeeping gene control, transcripts of cyclophillin A (PPIA) were determined (Assay ID: Hs99999904 for human PPIA). The amount of the K6A transcripts was normalized to the control gene using the &#x394;CT method.For the detection of K6 in organ cultured human skin as well as cultured HaCaT KCs, indirect immunofluorescence staining was performed using mouse anti-human K6 antibody (Progen, Ks6.KA12) at 1:10 dilution as a primary antibody and rhodamine conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) at 1:200 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a secondary antibody.To study the proliferation of epidermal KCs, double-immunostaining for K6 and Ki-67 was performed. Briefly, after the staining for K6 with FITC conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) as a secondary antibody, sections were incubated overnight at 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C with a mouse anti-human Ki-67 antibody (DAKO, Hamburg, Germany) at 1:20 in PBS. Sections were then washed with PBS, followed by incubation with rhodamine conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) (1:200 in PBS, 45&#xA0;min) at room temperature.To investigate the localization of CB1 and K6, double immunostaining was performed. For CB1 immunostaining, the highly sensitive tyramide signal amplification (TSA) technique (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA) was applied. Cryosections were incubated overnight at 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C with rabbit anti-CB1 (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) at 1:400 diluted in TNB (Tris, NaOH, Blocking reagent, TSA kit; Perkin-Elmer). Thereafter, the samples were labeled with goat biotinylated antibody against rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) at 1:200 in TNB for 45&#xA0;min at room temperature. Sections were then stained with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (1:100, 30&#xA0;min, TSA kit) and were finally incubated with rhodamine conjugated tyramide (1:50, TSA kit). The TSA method was applied according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol. For the second primary labeling, mouse anti-human K6 antibody (Progen) was applied at 1:20 in PBS, overnight at 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C. After the wash with PBS, the sections were incubated with FITC conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) (1:200 in PBS, 45&#xA0;min) at room temperature.For K16 antigen detection, we used the LSAB (DCS, Germany) detection method () using the K16-gp as primary antibody (guinea-pig, PROGEN, Heidelberg, Germany, dilution 1:1000, GP-CK16), and biotinylated goat anti-guinea pig as secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA, dilution 1:200). &#xA0;HistoGreen (Linaris, Wertheim-Bettingen, Germany) was used as peroxidase substrate.For all immunostainings, the respective primary antibodies were omitted as negative controls, and morphological criteria and reproduction of the previously published intracutaneous expression patterns of the examined antigens were used as internal positive and negative controls (). For all experiments, control and treated sections were stained (and later evaluated) on the same day by the same investigator. To avoid staining biases, we calculated the relative staining intensity (arbitrary intensity; 1 as control group) among treatment groups per each individual and then pooled data from all of the experiments.High magnification images of K6/Ki67 double immunofluorescence and K6 immunofluorescence on HaCaT cells were taken by laser scanning confocal microscopy (Fluoview 300, Olympus Tokyo, Japan) running Fluoview 2.1 software (Olympus).The staining intensity of K6 and K16 in defined reference areas was assessed by quantitative immunohistomorphometry using the ImageJ software (NIH: National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (; ; ). For epidermal evaluation, staining intensity was evaluated in the suprabasal cells, and for HaCaT cells, staining intensity was measured in the colonies formed. For K6 immunofluorescence intensity, skin sections from 4 different individuals were used, while K16 immunofluorescence intensity and %Ki67 were evaluated in skin sections from 2 patients. 4&#x2013;6 sections per one individual (2 sections per investigated skin fragment) were used for each evaluation. Each section was evaluated in two/three different non-adjacent microscopic fields (&#xD7;200), and the mean intensity was measured, and considered as a value. Each treatment group was compared to the control group (average value), and relative change in expression was calculated. Highly comparable results were obtained from different sections from different individuals.
