The packaging plasmid pgp3virin () and the envelope expression plasmid, pMD.G encoding VSV-G () have been described previously. The wild-type vector was derived form pTR167 () and was modified to contain a frame-shift mutation in  and an inactivated  open reading frame. It contains a simian virus 40-Hyg (SV-Hyg) cassette at the unique NheI site of the truncated  sequence upstream of the RRE (). The RI(-) vector and the SacII(-) vector were derived from wild-type vector, by digestion with EcoRI or SacII followed by repair using T4 polymerase and religation, respectively. The Aug(-) vector was created using PCR based mutagenesis as follows: The Hyg gene was amplified using a pair of primers but with the sense primer targeting the 5&#x2032; coding of the Hyg gene lacked the AUG codon. The amplified product was positioned downstream of the SV40 early promoter between the BamHI and XhoI restriction enzyme sites. The dual-Hyg containing vectors RI(-)/Aug(-) and SacII(-)/Aug(-) were created in multiple steps. First the Hyg sequence lacking the AUG codon was positioned downstream of the RRE and between BamHI and XhoI sites. Next the SV-Hyg cassette from RI(-) and SacII(-) vectors was released with NheI and ligated into the NheI site upstream of the RRE to give RI(-)/Aug(-) and SacII(-)/Aug(-), respectively (). The &#x394;RRE vector was created by digestion of SacII(-)/Aug(-) vector with EcoRI and dropping the EcoRI fragment between the EcoRI sites of the two Hyg sequences, thus eliminating the RRE, prior to religation ().(A) The genetic organization of HIV-1 proviral clone pNL4-3 depicting the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; long-terminal repeats (LTRs), protein coding regions, and the Rev-response element (RRE). Important restriction enzyme sites used in the creation of the gene transfer vectors are shown on a horizontal line below. (B) Schematic of RRE-deleting gene transfer vectors. The wild-type vector is shown at the top in B. It contains a single Hyg sequence driven under control of simian virus 40 early promoter (SV) that is positioned upstream of the RRE. The RRE-deleting vectors contain two non-functional Hyg sequences, one upstream, and the other downstream of the RRE. There are two versions of this vector: The RI(-)/Aug(-) version contains a mutation at the EcoRI (RI) site, while the SacII(-)/Aug(-) version contains a mutation at the SacII site, in the upstream Hyg gene. Both vectors carry a deletion of the AUG initiator codon (Aug(-)) in the Hyg sequence downstream of the RRE. A vector that has the RRE sequence deleted, &#x394;RRE, is shown at the bottom.Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cellswere obtained from American type culture collection (ATCC; catalog number SD-3515). The HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco&#x2019;s modified Eagle&#x2019;s medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 &#xB5;g/ml streptomycin and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone/ThermoFisherScientific, USA). HeLa cells were maintained in Iscoves medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 &#xB5;g/ml streptomycin and 10% heat-inactivated newborn calf serum (Hyclone/ThermoFisherScientific, USA).The packaging plasmid, pgp3virin encoding Gag/Gag-Pro-Pol and all accessory and regulatory HIV-1 protein (3.75 &#xB5;g), VSV-G envelope expression construct, pMD.G (0.2 &#xB5;g) and the gene transfer vector (7.5 &#xB5;g) were transfected into 293T cells in T25 flasks using the CaPO method as previously described (). For some experiments, in place of pgp3virin, we used an alternative packaging and helper constructs consisting of pGP-HIV-1 350 RRE encoding Gag and Gag-Pro-Pol (1.5 &#xB5;g), pCMVtat (0.1 &#xB5;g) and pCI-Rev (0.1 &#xB5;g) () for transfection in 6-well plates. Vector stocks were harvested 72 h later, clarified by centrifugation at 2500 &#xD7; rpm (1400 &#xD7; g) at 4&#xB0;C for 15 min and stored at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C in aliquots or used immediately for titration on HeLa cells.HIV-1 p24 ELISA was done using a commercial kit obtained from PerkinElmer (Massachusetts, USA) using the recommended protocol.HeLa cells were seeded into 6-well plates (200,000 cells/well) one day prior to infection with vector stocks. Next day, each well received 200 &#xB5;l, 20 &#xB5;l or 2 &#xB5;l of vector stock in 1 ml of Iscoves growth medium containing 8 &#xB5;g/ml polybrene. After overnight incubation at 37&#xB0;C, the polybrene was diluted with 2 ml of complete growth medium. The following day, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing either hygromycin B (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) (200 &#xB5;g/ml) or G418 (Life Technologies, NY, 1 mg/ml). This was replaced every 3&#x2013;4 days with fresh medium containing the selection agent. After 12&#x2013;14 days, when no live cells were noted in control untransduced cultures, and colonies were visible in test cultures, the medium was aspirated, and the cells fixed and stained using 0.5% crystal violet in 50% methanol before enumeration.This was done using Qiagen DNeasy miniprep kits (Qiagen, Maryland, USA) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s recommended protocol and included an Rnase I treatment step.This was done in a Bio-Rad CFX96 thermocycler using iQ SYBR green supermix in 20 &#xB5;l reaction volumes using 60 ng of template DNA and 200 nM concentration of each primer. A two-step PCR was used with an annealing and extension temperature of 63.1&#xB0;C and a denaturation temperature of 95&#xB0;C for a total of 40 cycles. The SYBR Green fluorescence was detected during the annealing and extension step (63.1&#xB0;C). A final melt-curve analysis was done by ramping up the temperature from 65&#xB0;C to 80&#xB0;C in 0.5&#xB0;C increments. Ten-fold dilutions of genomic DNA transduced with control &#x2018;wild-type&#x2019; vector were used to generate standard curves. In addition to using primer pairs targeting RRE and , we also tested each genomic DNA sample using primers against &#x3B2;-actin to ensure that equal amounts of DNA samples (as deduced from spectroscopically estimated DNA concentrations) could be amplified to a similar extent, and that there were no PCR inhibitors in the final reaction mix. The primer sequences used to amplify , RRE or &#x3B2;-actin are shown in . Relative quantities of RRE to  were estimated as previously described () and detailed in the footnote to .
