Seventeen adult subjects (12 male, 5 female) with normal or corrected-to-normal vision participated in the experiment. Age and education information was not obtained. Sixteen naive subjects were paid $15/session and one subject was an author (MBM). Experiments were carried out under the guidelines of the Barrow Neurological Institute&#x2019;s Institutional Review Board (protocol number 04BN039). Written informed consent was obtained from each subject.Subjects rested their forehead and chin on the EyeLink 1000 head/chin support 57&#xA0;cm away from a linearized video monitor (Barco Reference Calibrator V, 75&#xA0;Hz refresh rate). Subjects were instructed to look at the center of a circular target presented on the center of the monitor&#x2019;s screen, on a 50% gray background. Target luminance and size varied randomly across trials. Eleven possible luminance levels (ranging from 5% to 95% in 9% steps) and six possible radius sizes (0.033&#xB0;, 0.067&#xB0;, 0.133&#xB0;, 0.267&#xB0;, 0.533&#xB0;, and 1.067&#xB0;) resulted in a total of 66 experimental conditions. Note that, for a luminance level of 50%, there was no fixation target, and in this case the subjects were instructed to look at the center of the monitor. The experiment consisted of 4 sessions of&#xA0;30&#xA0;min, with each session including 33 randomly interleaved trials of 30&#xA0;s each. Each subject saw each fixation target twice (i.e.&#xA0;60&#xA0;s of presentation time for each visible fixation target condition) and the no fixation target condition 12 times (i.e.&#xA0;360&#xA0;s: 6 sizes at 50% luminance, with each size seen twice). Subjects took short (2&#x2013;5&#xA0;min) breaks after each 11 trials. Subjects&#x2019; eye position was calibrated at the beginning of the experimental session, and re-calibrated after each break. We used custom code and the Psychophysics Toolbox (; ; ) to display visual stimuli. To disregard the potential effect of the initial stimulus onset transient at the start of each trial, we conducted analyses only on data recorded after the first second of the trial.Binocular eye position was acquired noninvasively with a video eye tracker at 500&#xA0;Hz (EyeLink 1000, SR Research, instrument noise 0.01&#xB0;&#xA0;RMS). We identified and removed blinks as portions of the raw data where pupil information was missing. We also removed portions of data where very fast decreases and increases in pupil area occurred (&gt;50&#xA0;units/sample, such periods are probably semi-blinks where the pupil is never fully occluded) (; ). We added 200 ms before and after each blink/semi-blink to eliminate the initial and final parts where the pupil was still partially occluded (). Saccades were identified with a modified version of the algorithm developed by Engbert and Kliegl (; ; ; ; ) with &#x3BB;&#xA0;=&#xA0;4 (used for the velocity threshold detection) and a minimum saccadic duration of 6 ms. To reduce the amount of potential noise, we considered only binocular saccades, that is, saccades with a minimum overlap of one data sample in both eyes (; ; ; ). Some saccades are followed by a fast and small saccadic eye movement in the opposite direction, called dynamic overshoot, which is often more prominent in the eye that moves in the abducting direction (). Unlike the return saccade in a SWJ, a dynamic overshoot follows a saccade without latency between the two movements. We identified dynamic overshoots as saccades that occurred less than 20 ms after a preceding saccade () and did not consider them as new saccades. Microsaccades were defined as saccades with magnitude &lt;2&#xB0;&#xA0;in each eye (; ; ; ;&#xA0;; ). This threshold was selected to accommodate the shift to increased microsaccade magnitudes that occurred with larger target sizes (&#xA0;). When calculating microsaccade properties such as magnitude, peak velocity, and direction we averaged the values for the right and left eyes. See  for microsaccade descriptive statistics and the microsaccadic main sequence (peak-velocity relationship).(A) Average microsaccade magnitude distribution across subjects and experimental conditions.

(B) Microsaccadic peak velocity-magnitude relationship for all subjects combined. Each red dot represents a microsaccade.(A) Microsaccade rate decreased linearly with target size ((5,80)&#xA0;=&#xA0;20.24,&#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;0.0001; linear trend (1,16)&#xA0;=&#xA0;16.00,&#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;0.0001). (B) Microsaccade rate did not change significantly with target luminance ((9,144)&#xA0;=&#xA0;2.14,&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.082). (C) Microsaccade magnitude increased linearly with target size ((5,80)&#xA0;=&#xA0;28.96,&#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;0.0001; linear trend (1,16)&#xA0;=&#xA0;39.20,&#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;0.0001). (D) Microsaccade magnitude did not change significantly with target luminance ((9,144)&#xA0;=&#xA0;1.6,&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.121). (E) Fixation eccentricity increased linearly with target size ((5,80)&#xA0;=&#xA0;5.82,&#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;0.001; linear trend (1,16)&#xA0;=&#xA0;9.71,&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.007). (F) Fixation eccentricity did not change significantly with target luminance ((9,144)&#xA0;=&#xA0;1.16,&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.326). Microsaccade rate (B) was lower, whereas microsaccade magnitude (D) and fixation eccentricity (F) were higher, when the fixation target was absent compared to present (rate: (16)&#xA0;=&#xA0;2.96,&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.009; magnitude: (16)&#xA0;=&#xA0;&#x2212;5.64,&#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;0.001; fixation eccentricity: (16)&#xA0;=&#xA0;&#x2212;5.94,&#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;0.0001). Error bars represent the s.e.m. across subjects (&#xA0;=&#xA0;17).We defined a SWJ as the combination of one small saccade that moves the eye away from the fixation target, followed after a short period by a second corrective saccade directed back towards the target (; ; ; ). We identified SWJs using the algorithm developed in . This method measures how similar a given saccade pair (that is, a pair of consecutive saccades) is to an ideal SWJ. In an &#x201C;ideal SWJ&#x201D; the two saccades are separated by a short interval (usually around 200 ms), have the same magnitudes, and their directions are exactly opposite (). We calculated a SWJ index based on the these three defining SWJ characteristics: (a) the direction dissimilarity of first and second saccade, (b) the magnitude similarity of first and second saccade, and (c) the temporal proximity of first and second saccade. The SWJ index provides a single, continuous variable between zero and one for each saccade pair. Values closer to one indicate more similarity to an ideal SWJ. If a saccade pair&#x2019;s SWJ index was larger than a given threshold (), we classified the pair as a SWJ. We defined SWJ magnitude as the average magnitude of the two saccades defining the SWJ, for the eye that the SWJ occurred in (SWJs are not necessarily conjugate, though most are ). Thus, we averaged the magnitudes of all SWJs in each eye, and then averaged across eyes (). Similarly, we calculated SWJ ISIs by determining the average SWJ ISI for each eye, and then averaging across eyes.To assess the effects of target luminance and size on microsaccades and SWJs, we performed a repeated measures ANOVA on each of the dependent variables: microsaccade rate, microsaccade magnitude, SWJ magnitude, SWJ ISI, SWJ prevalence, the deviation of microsaccade direction from horizontal, and fixation eccentricity (i.e.&#xA0;gaze distance to the center of the target, or to the center of the screen if no target was present) after a microsaccade. Target luminance (10 levels, we excluded the luminance level of 50% because it matched the background luminance, thus the target was invisible) and size (6 levels) were the within subjects factors variables. For violations of the ANOVA assumption of sphericity, -values were adjusted using the Greenhouse-Geisser correction. To compare microsaccade characteristics with vs. without a fixation target, we performed two tailed paired -tests on the same dependent variables. In this case, we collapsed all fixation target conditions with luminance&#xA0;&#x2260;&#xA0;50% for the fixation target condition; a fixation target with luminance&#xA0;=&#xA0;50% corresponded to the no fixation target condition. Significance levels were set at &#x3B1;&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.05 throughout.
