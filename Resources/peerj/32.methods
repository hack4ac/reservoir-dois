The trial and its protocol have been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (Ethical protocol no HUS 357/E0/05). The subjects provided written informed consent. The details of this trial have been published previously (; ).The subjects were healthy Finnish adults (&#xA0;=&#xA0;25, 18 females, 7 males) with a mean age of 42&#xA0;years (23&#x2013;55) and a mean BMI of 24&#xA0;kg/m (18&#x2013;30) from Helsinki region, representing a subset of a larger cohort (; ). The CONSORT flowchart () summarizes the subject enrollment, intervention allocation, follow-up, and data analysis during the study. The subject characteristics are provided in .Flowchart of the study subjects during the trial.The subjects constituted two treatment groups in a randomized, double blind intervention study to receive either  GG (probiotic; &#xA0;=&#xA0;11) or placebo (&#xA0;=&#xA0;14). During the intervention the subjects consumed daily a 250 mL milk-based fruit drink containing either  GG (ATCC 53103, 6.2&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;10 cfu/mL) or a similar placebo drink without probiotic bacteria for three weeks. No other probiotic-containing products were allowed three weeks prior or during the intervention; a list of fermented foods and commercial probiotic-containing products was given to the subjects. The subjects were not separately questioned about their abstinence from probiotic products, but they filled a study diary recording the daily intake of the study product.Three fecal samples per individual were collected three weeks before, during and three weeks after the intervention, as previously described (). The fecal DNA extraction with modified Promega method, and quantification of the probiotic counts with a strain-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay have been described previously (). The phylogenetic analysis of the intestinal microbiota composition with the HITChip microarray was performed as previously described (; ). The phylogenetic HITChip microarray targets the V1 and V6 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene of over 1000 bacterial phylotypes that present the majority of the so far detected phylotypes of the human intestine. Phylogenetic organization of the microarray probes and data preprocessing have been explained in detail elsewhere (; ; ). Quantification of the relative differences in the taxon abundance between samples was obtained by summarizing the probe signals to phylotype (species-like), genus and phylum levels. Genus-level taxa with&#xA0;&#x2265;&#xA0;90% sequence similarity in the 16S rRNA gene are referred to as  and relatives, the latter being shortened in the text as &#x201C;.&#x201D; ().Previously, HITChip-derived microbial profiles have been shown to correlate well with those obtained with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) () and pyrosequencing (). Samples were also used for absolute quantification of total bacteria, methanogenic Archaea,  group and  spp. with previously described qPCR primers and reaction conditions ().Of the 25 study subjects used for the microbiota analysis, 22 (8 from probiotic group and 14 from placebo group) were available for the parallel analysis of serum lipid profiles before and after the intervention (44 samples in total). Venous blood samples from the antecubital vein were taken at baseline and after the three-week intervention. The blood samples were stored at &#x2212;20&#xA0;&#xB0;C for further analyses. Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol as well as triglyceride levels were enzymatically determined from the serum as previously described ().Extraction of lipids from the serum samples, analysis of the lipid extracts with Waters Q-Tof Premier mass spectrometer combined with an Acquity Ultra Performance LC (UPLC), data preprocessing and identification of the lipid molecular species is described in detail elsewhere (). Lipids have been named according to Lipid Maps () with the following abbreviations: Cer: ceramide; ChoE: cholesteryl ester; lysoPC: lysophosphatidylcholine; PA: phosphatidic acid; PG: phosphatidylglycerol; PC: phosphatidylcholine; PS: phosphatidylserine; SM: sphingomyelin; TG: triglyceride. Where the fatty acid composition could not be determined, the total number of carbons and double bonds is indicated. The first number indicates the amount of carbon atoms in the fatty acid molecule, followed by the number of double bonds.The effects of probiotic intervention on the intestinal microbiota were investigated with a combination of linear models, sparse principal component analysis (PCA; ; ), unsupervised hierarchical clustering, and significance testing. The log-transformed HITChip and lipid profiling values were approximately Gaussian distributed and fulfilled the general statistical assumptions underlying the selected computational approaches. Background variables, including age, body-mass index and gender were compared in the baseline samples to exclude potentially confounding effects associated with these variables. The Wilcoxon test was used with continuous variables and the Fisher exact test for categorical variables, followed by Benjamini&#x2013;Hochberg -value correction for multiple testing. No significant differences between the background variables were observed between the treatment groups (&#xA0;&gt;&#xA0;0.05 in all comparisons). The two-group comparisons between the time points and between the treatment groups were quantified based on a linear model with group-wise fixed effects and sample-specific random effects, as implemented in the limma R package (), to identify bacterial taxa with significant changes induced by the probiotic intervention and to assess the magnitude and significance of the effects. The function lmFit was used to fit the linear model, followed by significance estimation by empirical Bayes as described in . In addition, power calculation was carried out to assess statistical power of the current study. The original data was randomly permuted, one significant 2-fold alteration was inserted, and Gaussian noise was added using the same average standard deviation as in the original data. Empirical power calculation with 1000 random permutations showed that 2-fold and higher alterations that follow the noise levels in the original data were detected in&#xA0;&gt;&#xA0;99.8% of the cases with sample size of 8 or more, based on the same detection criteria than in the current study, confirming the high statistical power of the analysis at the present sample size. PCA is a linear dimension reduction method used to compress information in the high-dimensional phylogenetic (genus-level) and lipid profiles into few informative features that capture the main variation in the data and allow two-dimensional visualization of sample similarities. The temporal and inter-individual similarity of the microbiota and lipid profiles was assessed by average intra- and inter-individual Pearson correlations () between and within the time points, respectively. The differences in profile similarity between the probiotic and placebo groups were estimated with Wilcoxon test. The biweight midcorrelation, which is more robust to outliers than the standard Pearson correlation, was used to quantify correlation between the microbiota and lipid profiles across the individuals. High-throughput screening studies involve considerable multiple testing and the traditional multiple testing correction approaches are prohibitively conservative in this context due to their emphasis on estimating the probability of a single false positive finding. Hence, we have used -values for multiple testing correction in the high-throughput screening tests that include parallel comparisons of large numbers of lipids and bacterial phylotypes.The biweight midcorrelation measure was used to quantify associations between the microbiota and lipid profiling data sets, and between the microbiota and biochemically determined lipids. The correlations between genus-level bacterial groups and lipid species were calculated together with significance estimates that were corrected for multiple testing. The significantly correlated (&#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;0.05) phylotypes and lipids were selected for further analysis. It is important to note, however, that while the present sample size of 22 samples across 2 time points (before and during the probiotic intervention) is sufficient for highlighting significant correlation patterns, the present experimental design cannot uncover causal relationships and the observed correlations may be partly associated with diet or other confounding variables that simultaneously affect both lipid and microbiota profiles. Two-way average linkage hierarchical clustering of the bacterial taxa and lipids was applied to highlight and visualize groups of phylotypes and lipids sharing similar correlation patterns. Analogous &#x2018;second-order&#x2019; correlations have previously been applied for instance in the context of gene expression studies (; ). A constant plaid model biclustering was used for systematic detection of significantly correlated bacterial and lipid groups on the correlation heatmap (). To interpret the detected biclusters, statistical enrichment (over-representation) of the implicated bacteria was quantified. Moreover, enrichment analysis was carried out for lipids containing even or odd number of carbon atoms, as well as the enrichment of lipids with zero, one or more double bonds. The enrichment analyses were carried out with Fisher&#x2019;s exact test (). All analyses were performed within the R statistical environment ().
