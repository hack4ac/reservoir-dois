The study was conducted at the Koffler Scientific Reserve (KSR) at Joker&#x2019;s Hill (King City, Ontario, Canada; ), a 350-hectare property containing a mix of primary forest, secondary forest and open habitats, including a large area of old field sites. I was granted permission by the site director &#x2013; Ann Zimmerman &#x2013; to conduct the research there.I haphazardly selected 38 10 &#xD7; 10 meter plots spread across the available old field habitat at KSR. In early August, I surveyed each plot within 4 randomly placed 1 &#xD7; 1 meter quadrats, one in each of the four quadrants of the larger plot. I noted the presence or absence of each forb species within the quadrats and combined the data from all four quadrats into a low resolution measure of abundance (ranging from 0&#x2013;4) for each species within each 10 &#xD7; 10 meter plot. I decided to focus on forbs to the exclusion of grasses for several reasons. Herbivory from chewing insect is difficult to measure on grasses but is obvious on forbs. There were only two common species of grass, which occurred in nearly every one of the plots surveyed, and so inclusion of grasses in the phylogenetic diversity measures would have only diluted the signal from the forbs. I hypothesized that phylogenetic diversity amongst forbs would be the most important to understanding herbivory on forbs. This is because grasses and forbs share few herbivores, except for the most generalist. As an example,  showed that the largest difference in arthropod communities collected from different prairie plant species was between grasses and forbs.Using this data, I calculated the species richness and abundance-weighted phylogenetic diversity for all 38 plots. This data, along with the species composition of all 38 plots, can be found in  in Supplemental Information.In order to quantify the amount of herbivore damage in the plots, I selected 27 of the most common species at KSR to measure damage (). These species acted as phytometers to capture the overall herbivore pressure in the plot. In late August &#x2013; over a period of approximately two weeks &#x2013; I measured herbivore damage rates in the 38 plots. For each of the phytometer species that occured in a given plot, I sampled 10 individual plants by counting the number of damaged leaves and the number of total leaves on each one. The dataset then consisted of 1862 datapoints, each from an individual plant.Species highlighted in grey are species for which herbivore damage measurements were taken. Branch lengths represent divergence times. Methods for generating the tree can be found in .I chose this set of phytometer species before the commencement of the study, based on my personal knowledge of which species seemed to make up the most apparent membership of the old field communities (i.e., the &#x2018;overstory&#x2019;). This intuition seems justified, because of the 25 species which were surveyed in the plots, but for which I did not measure damage, 17 were found in only 1 or 2 plots (&lt;5% of total plots), and 24 were found in 5 or fewer plots (&lt;13% of total plots). It is unlikely that measurements of herbivory on these species could have changed the results presented here substantially, unless rare species systematically differed in their response to plant diversity. The one exception to this general pattern was , which was found in 16 plots and was not measured for herbivory. However,  is an understory plant, which remains as a rosette for most of its life history. It only produces a few leaves (4&#x2013;10), all of which usually sustain some herbivore damage (personal observation). Given this lack of variation in herbivory within  under the method of measurement that I chose, it would be unlikely to affect the results substantially (because if there is no variation, then it cannot vary with plant diversity or anything else). For full information on species abundances across the 38 plots, see .I created a phylogenetic tree containing all the most common old field species found at my site using methods previously described (). I then pruned the tree so that the remaining species matched those found in the plots used for this study ().Using this phylogeny I calculated an index of abundance-weighted phylogenetic diversity for each plot. There are several such indices available &#x2013; I chose Phylogenetic Species Evenness (PSE; ). PSE measures the amount of evolutionary history represented in a community by calculating the expected variance in a hypothetical continuous trait modeled as evolving through Brownian motion across the community phylogeny, and is standardized by the expected variance of the same modeled trait on a star phylogeny &#x2013; where phylogenetic distances among all species are equal. This captures one of the fundamental features of interest in phylogenetic diversity: that it may encapsulate information about the ecological similarity of species in a community. I chose PSE for this reason, and because it is theoretically (and empirically in this study) independent of species richness. Thus, by using it, I could evaluate the  contributions of species richness and phylogenetic diversity without the problems of co-linearity and heteroscedasticity common to many other phylogenetic diversity indices (e.g., ; ). PSE ranges between 0 and 1, where high values are associated with high phylogenetic diversity. Low values are associated with low phylogenetic diversity, or phylogenetic clustering &#x2013; small average phylogenetic distances among species in the community. It is possible that I could have seen different results with a different metric, but PSE is highly correlated with a number of other metrics (), and so the results presented here should at least apply to this general &#x2018;class&#x2019; of phylogenetic diversity indices.I used species richness rather than an abundance-weighted measure because I was interested in the effects of adding or subtracting species. This combined with the phylogenetic diversity measure can give a statistical measure of adding species of different phylogenetic distances from the species already present. In addition, abundance weighting is easily interpretable for a measure like phylogenetic diversity, because in essence it is a weighted average, and phylogeny is made from continuous measures of branch length. On the other hand, abundance weighted measures like the Shannon-Weaver index are abstracted quantities with no simple interpretation biologically (e.g., ; ). I did calculate evenness for the plots and it was not correlated with phylogenetic diversity, and so the phylogenetic diversity measure, though abundance-weighted, was not confounded with species evenness. In addition, evenness was not a significant predictor of herbivory when included as a factor in the model described below, and so I did not use it.In order to account for variation in species composition across plots, I used a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with crossed random effects, to disentangle species and plot-level effects on herbivory. The number of damaged leaves on a plant can be modelled as a binomial distribution, with a damaged leaf considered a Bernoulli success (for the herbivores) and an undamaged leaf a failure. Factors that may influence the probability of a leaf being damaged were incorporated into the model with a logit link.I used a logit-normal-binomial statistical model to analyze the data, as follows:   
                 
                where  is the number of damaged leaves on individual plant ,  is the probability of any given leaf on plant  being damaged, and  is the total number of leaves on plant .  and    are the phylogenetic diversity and the species richness, respectively, for the plot in which plant  was found.  is the date on which I sampled the plot, to control for any increases in herbivory that may have occurred while the sampling was ongoing.  and  are the random effects for species and plot, respectively.  is a random effect for the individual observation which was included to account for any over- or under-dispersion in the data since the binomial distribution contains no variance parameter. The &#x3B1; (intercept) and &#x3B2; parameters are the fixed effects.I used the lme4 package () for R statistical environment () to fit the model.Plot level herbivory (after accounting for species-level variation, sampling date, and observation) can then be estimated as the best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) &#x2013; sometimes referred to as the conditional modes &#x2013; of  (hereafter estimated proportional leaf damage). For plot , this is equal to . Likewise, herbivory of species  (after accounting for plot-level variation, sampling date and observation) is . These values were used for plotting ( and ).On the left is the phylogenetic relationships of the species with branch length representing time since divergence. On the right is a bar chart whose bars represent the best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) or conditional modes of the estimated proportional leaf damage for each species. Error bars are based on the conditional variance-covariance matrix generated by the model fitting procedure (lmer function in the lme4 package for R) and are conditional mode + /&#x2212; 1 conditional standard deviation.(A) Points represent best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) or conditional modes of plots. The size of the points is proportional to the species richness of the plot so that large points are speciose communities. Error bars are based on the conditional variance-covariance matrix generated by the model fitting procedure (lmer function in the lme4 package for R) and are conditional mode + /&#x2212; 1 conditional standard deviation. Fitted lines are back-transformed predicted values from the full generalized linear mixed model, for four different pre-set values of species richness (3, 6, 12, &amp; 17) representing the full range of species richnesses in this study. (B) A heatmap which shows the back-transformed fitted surface of the full generalized linear mixed model. Points are the plot BLUPs, their colour represents their value as per the legend. Points that are darker than the surrounding colour fall below the predicted surface; points which are lighter fall above it.All continuous predictor variables were centred by subtracting their means prior to analysis, so that the main effect of the variable refers to its slope at the mean of all other variables.Significance of the relationships between estimated proportional leaf damage and the fixed factors was determined using a parametric bootstrap approach. For each fixed factor, data was simulated under a simplified model without the fixed factor of interest. The full model was then fit to the simulated data and the  statistic was calculated. The observed  statistic from the full model was then compared to the distribution of  values obtained from 1000 such simulations, and a  value determined as the percent of simulated  values whose absolute value was greater than or equal to the absolute value of the observed -value ().
