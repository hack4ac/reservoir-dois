Participants were 12 young adults ( = 21 years, range = 18&#x2013;30 years) and 12 older adults ( = 73 years, range = 65&#x2013;79 years) from the University of Leicester and the local community. All participants were native speakers of English and both age groups had similar educational backgrounds. Screening established that participants did not suffer from eye disease or disorders, or visual or reading impairment (e.g., dyslexia). Participants&#x2019; visual abilities were assessed using Bailey&#x2013;Lovie (), ETDRS (), and Pelli-Robson () tests. Assessments confirmed that participants were properly refracted at the screen distance used in the experiment. Older adults showed typical lower acuity than young adults (young adults,  = 20/18, older adults,  = 20/25, where acuity is reported in Snellen values). Older adults also showed lower sensitivity to higher spatial frequencies than young adults (log contrast sensitivity: young adults,  = 1.81, older adults,  = 1.76), which again is typical for these age groups (e.g., see ). Ethical approval for this research was obtained from the School of Psychology Ethics Committee at the University of Leicester (Ref. kbp3-b004). Informed written consent was obtained from all participants.Stimuli consisted of 120 sentences. Each sentence was shown in 1 of 6 display conditions, shown either entirely as normal (unfiltered) or with the spatial frequency content of the text filtered so that only one of 5 bands of restricted spatial frequencies were present, ranging from very low to very high (see ). This filtered text was created using MATLAB to digitally filter each sentence into 5 different, 1-octave wide bands of spatial frequencies with peak frequencies of 2.2, 3.5, 4.9, 6.7, 11.1, and 13.7 cycles per degree (cpd) and low-pass and high-pass cut-off frequencies of 1.65&#x2013;3.3, 2.6&#x2013;5.2, 5.0&#x2013;10.0, 8.3&#x2013;16.6, and 10.3&#x2013;20.6 cpd (for further details, see ; ). This was achieved by point-wise multiplication in the frequency domain using fourth-order high- and low-pass Butterworth filters. These filters provide a mathematically tractable filter shape that avoids the problems of ringing associated with other filter shapes with a sharp cut-off. The 5 bands of spatial frequencies produced were termed very low, low, medium, high, and very high.All 120 sentences were randomized and sampled using a Latin square so that each participant saw 20 sentences shown in each of the 6 display conditions. This ensured that all sentences were shown equally often in each condition in the experiment but prevented repetition of any sentence for any participant. Sentences were shown to each participant in a randomized order across two sessions. An additional 12 sentences (2 per condition) were presented as practice items, 6 at the beginning of each session. Indications of the displays used in the experiment are shown in .Eye movements were recorded using an Eyelink 2K tower-mounted eye-tracker with chin and forehead rest. This eye-tracker has a spatial resolution of .01&#xB0; and the position of each participant&#x2019;s right eye was sampled at 1000 Hz using corneal reflection and pupil tracking. Sentences were displayed on a 19 inch monitor and a 4-letter word subtended approximately 1&#xB0; (i.e., normal size for reading; ).At the beginning of the experiment, participants were informed that sentences might be difficult to read, and that they should always attempt to read normally, and for comprehension. The eye-tracker was then calibrated. At the start of each trial, a fixation square (equal in size to 1 character space) was presented in the center left of the screen. Once the participant fixated this location accurately, a sentence was presented, with the first letter of the sentence replacing the square. Participants were instructed to press a response key once they finished reading each sentence. Each sentence was then replaced by a comprehension question about the content of the sentence (e.g., &#x201C;Was the room useful for storage?&#x201D;) to which each participant responded. Calibration was checked between trials and the eye-tracker was recalibrated as necessary.
