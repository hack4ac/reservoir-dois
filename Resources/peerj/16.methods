Protein coordinates were obtained from the protein database, PDB accession code 3RVY (). Only the pore forming region from residue 115 to 221 was included in the simulations. In order to conduct the molecular dynamics simulations, the protein was placed in a pre-equilibrated POPC lipid bilayer, solvated in a 72&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;72&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;82 &#x212B; box of TIP3P water with 250 mM NaCl, yielding a system with approximately 41,000 atoms as depicted in . The protein was initially held fixed while the lipid and water were allowed to equilibrate for 2 ns, before the protein alpha carbons were restrained with a harmonic potential of force constant decreasing from 10 to 0.01 kcal/mol in 8 steps each lasting 1 ns. To account for the lipid molecules protruding into the centre of the pore in the crystal structure, the tails of four lipid molecules were restrained to the crystallographic positions with a force constant slowly increasing during the period in which the protein was restrained. During data collection they were restrained with a force constant of 0.1&#xA0;kcal/mol/&#x212B;. A final 15 ns of equilibration were conducted at the final restraint values. In longer unrestrained simulations not described here, lipid remains constantly present in the lateral phenestrations. For the simulations involving , one  was replaced with  and an additional  added to neutralise the system.A cross section of the simulation system is shown, with two of the four protein chains shown in purple, lipid in brown,  in yellow,  in green and the volume sampled by water molecules indicated by the transparent surface.Potentials of mean force (PMF) were calculated using umbrella sampling (). To ensure other ions did not enter the selectivity filter during these simulations, all other ions were kept out of a sphere of radius 13 &#x212B; centred on the middle of the selectivity filter using harmonic repulsive potential with force constant 40&#xA0;kcal/mol/&#x212B;. When making 1 ion PMFs, the axial separation () of the ion of interest and the centre of mass of the alpha carbons of the selectivity filter (residues 175&#x2013;178) was restrained in 0.25 &#x212B; steps in the -direction with a force constant of 12 kcal/mol/&#x212B;. For the two ion PMFs a force constant of 7 kcal/mol/&#x212B; and 0.5 &#x212B; steps were employed. Simulations lasting 2 ns were conducted at each window, with the first ns regarded as equilibration time and analysis conducted on only the second ns. Thus each single ion PMF involves 101 simulations for a total of 202 ns. The 2 ion / PMF involves 695 simulations for a total of 1390 ns. To reduce the amount of equilibration time required in each umbrella window, a number of starting coordinates were generated in which one or two ions were swapped with equilibrated water molecules throughout the length of the pore. In the two ion case, this meant starting coordinates were generated with the ions separated by integer numbers of water molecules. Collective analysis was made with the weighted histogram analysis method.  using the implementation of Grossfield (). The axial coordinate used in all the graphs is zeroed at the position of the centre of mass of the alpha carbons of the selectivity filter. The single  PMF was obtained three times from three independent sets of simulations to gain an idea of the reproducibility of the results.Unless otherwise stated, all simulations employed the CHARMM27 force field with CMAP correction for the protein and , () CHARMM36 for lipids, () and  and  parameters from Joung (). Because of the uncertainties involved in using a non-polarisable force field to describe interactions with , care should be taken not to overemphasise quantitative results involving this ion. Simulations were conducted with NAMD () with periodic boundary conditions using the particle mesh Ewald scheme for calculating electrostatic interactions, a 1 fs time-step at constant pressure (1 atm) and temperature (298&#xA0;K) (NPT ensemble). A harmonic potential of 0.01 kcal/mol/&#x212B; was held on the alpha-carbon atoms, except for those forming the selectivity filter (residues 174&#x2013;183) during data production. Coordination numbers were defined as the number of non-hydrogen atoms within 3.0 &#x212B; of the ion, the approximate position of the first minimum in the bulk ion&#x2013;water oxygen radial distribution function.To calculate the dehydration energies of the ions, we used the method of alchemical free energy perturbation (FEP) following the approach previously taken to examine partial dehydration of monovalent ions (). To create a dehydration scenario similar to that for ions entering the channel, we first generated a water sphere of radius 15 &#x212B; with the test ion fixed at the center to represent the bulk solution. Beside this (20 &#x212B; from the center of the large sphere) we placed a smaller water sphere of radius 3.2 &#x212B; that contained the desired number of water molecules. Large constraints (100&#xA0;kcal/mol&#xA0;&#x212B;) were applied to keep all of the atoms in the constant-volume spheres, as was done previously (). Then, alchemical FEP calculations were performed for these systems in which the test ion was moved from the bulk&#x2013;water sphere to the small water cluster, replacing a water molecule that was moved in the opposite direction. All simulation parameters except for the force field parameters for  and  are the same as our previous study (). To calculate the cost of removing water beyond the second solvation shell a similar procedure was conducted except, the small sphere had a radius of 6 &#x212B; and contained 32 water molecules, the average number found within the first and second solvation shells for both ions in bulk simulations. Each FEP calculation was repeated 9 times and the results show the average free energy change and the standard error in the mean.
