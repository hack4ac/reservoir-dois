Synthetic human A&#x3B2; peptide was prepared in two separate ways. Firstly the A&#x3B2; lyophilised powder was dissolved in TFA and dried under a nitrogen stream. The remaining film was dissolved in 100% HFIP to a concentration of 1 mg/ml, sonicated 5 min in a bath sonicator and dried under a nitrogen stream. The HFIP treatment was repeated twice more and on final dissolving the peptide was dispensed into microcentrifuge tubes. After drying under a nitrogen stream, the peptide was further dried under vacuum for 1&#x2013;2 h to give a clear film.The second method was to take the original peptide and dissolve it in 10% (w/v)  at 0.5 mg/ml. The peptide was incubated for 10 min at room temperature followed by sonication (5 min) and then dispensed (0.5 ml) into microfuge tubes. The  was removed by lyophilisation to yield a salt free fluffy white peptide. All aliquots from both methods were then stored at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C. Immediately prior to use, the HFIP- and -treated and untreated A&#x3B2; were dissolved in 60 mM NaOH and the concentration determined by absorbance at 214 and 280 nm using extinction coefficients of 76848 M cm or 1490 M cm, respectively. In all cases the resuspended peptide was analysed by mass spectrometry and the peptide found to be unmodified with no trace of HFIP or .The ThT assays were conducted as described previously (; ), Briefly, A&#x3B2; reconstituted in 60 mM NaOH to a stock concentration &#x223C;200 &#xB5;M was diluted to a final concentration of 5 &#xB5;M in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 136.89 mM NaCl, 2.68 mM KCl, 6.39 mM , 1.47 mM ) pH 7.4 containing 30 &#xB5;M ThT. Vehicle controls of 60 mM NaOH were used to confirm that the typical dilution of between 1 in 50 to 1 in 200 did not significantly alter the pH of the PBS solution. The samples were dispensed (200 &#xB5;l) into a 96 well clear bottom plate and placed in a Flexstation 3 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), incubated at 37&#xB0;C with agitation every 7 min. The ThT fluorescence was measured every 7 min for 24 h using excitation and emission wavelengths of 440 nm and 485 nm, respectively.Carbon-coated 300-mesh copper grids were glow-discharged in nitrogen to render the carbon film hydrophilic. Samples were gently agitated, before pipetting (4 &#xB5;l) onto the grids. After 30 s adsorption time, the excess was drawn off using Whatman 541 filter paper. The grids were stained with 2% w/v potassium phosphotungstate, pH 7.2, for 10 s. Grids were air-dried before examination. The samples were examined using a Tecnai 12 Transmission Electron Microscope (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) at an operating voltage of 120 KV. Images were recorded using a Megaview III CCD camera and AnalySIS camera control software (Olympus).For dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments the A&#x3B2; dissolved in 60 mM NaOH (Stock concentration 500 &#xB5;M) was diluted into 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 buffer containing 10 mM EDTA to a final concentration of 100 &#xB5;M. This buffer was chosen to minimise aggregation as A&#x3B2; aggregates at a slower rate at this pH and EDTA was included to prevent metal induced aggregation (). Thus, the aggregation state of the resuspended material was not expected to change significantly during the time taken to prepare the peptide for DLS measurements. Vehicle controls were prepared at the concentrations used in the A&#x3B2; experiments. The pH of all reactions were checked to be pH 8.0. All reaction mixtures were filtered through a 0.2 &#xB5;m syringe filter before the concentration of the sample was measured to determine the degree of peptide loss during filtration. In all cases the concentration of peptide changed less than 5%. Subsequently, 20 &#xB5;l of the filtrate was loaded in quadruplicate into a Greiner 384-well low volume glass bottom plate. The plate was centrifuged (5 min, 1000 &#xD7; g) to pellet any remaining larger insoluble material prior to measurement. A total time of 20 min elapsed between the addition of the A&#x3B2; to the buffer and the acquiring of data from the plate.The DLS measurements were taken at 25&#xB0;C using a Dyna Pro Nano Star plate reader at the Bio21 Collaborative Crystallisation Centre at laser wavelength 830 nm, with temperature control capacity and auto-attenuation function. To ensure accurate readings, the final distribution was taken from an accumulation of 50 individual, 5 s DLS collections. Hydrodynamic radius () was calculated from the diffusion coefficient by the Stokes&#x2013;Einstein relationship.For SEC measurements the A&#x3B2; stock in 60 mM NaOH was diluted into PBS to a final concentration of 200 &#xB5;M and incubated at 25&#xB0;C for 20 min. The samples were centrifuged (5 min, 16,500 &#xD7; g) immediately before loading onto a S200 Superdex column (GE, 10/300 GL). The column was eluted with 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min for 1.5 column volumes. The elution of proteins was measured using a flow cell absorbance detector set at 280 nm. Molecular weight was estimated by comparison to the SEC protein calibrants (GE Healthcare).A slightly modified approach for solubilising the treated A&#x3B2; was used for SAXS measurements, whereby the lyophilised peptide (either treated with HFIP or , and typically in 3&#x2013;4 mg aliquots) was taken up in 20 &#xB5;l of 60 mM NaOH, which was immediately diluted to 13 mM NaOH with distilled water. This sample was sonicated for 5 min in a bath sonicator to ensure the peptide entered the solution at the lower concentration of NaOH. The sample was then neutralised with 10X PBS, resulting in a solution with a pH of 7.4 and centrifuged at 16,500 &#xD7; g in a benchtop microcentrifuge for 10 min. The 214 nm absorbance of the supernatant was measured to determine concentration using the above quoted extinction coefficient. Typically this process resulted in stock solutions of approximately 5&#x2013;7 mg/ml (1300&#x2013;1500 &#xB5;M). No differences in the kinetics of fibril formation, as measured by ThT fluorescence, were observed for direct dilution from 60 mM NaOH or 13 mM NaOH.SAXS measurements were acquired at the SAXS/WAXS beamline of the Australian Synchrotron (Clayton, Victoria, Australia). A&#x3B2; solutions, made using untreated, HFIP treated and  treated lyophilised peptide, solubilised using the above described NaOH solubilisation protocol (1 mg/ml, 221 &#xB5;M) were analysed at a camera length of 3.3 m corresponding to a range of momentum transfer 0.005 &#x2264;  &#x2264; 0.35 &#x212B; (where  = 4&#x3C0;sin&#x3B8;/&#x3BB;, 2&#x3B8; is the scattering angle and &#x3BB; is the X-ray wavelength: 1.03 &#x212B; at 12 KeV), using a Pilatus 1 M camera (Dectris, Switzerland). Data were normalised using an integrated beamstop and intensities put on an absolute scale using distilled water as a standard. To limit radiation damage, 50 &#xB5;l samples/buffers were flowed through a 1.5 mm quartz capillary and 10 frames of 1 s exposure collected. The individual frames were compared for agreement before being averaged with the scatterBrain IDL program, downloaded from the Australian synchrotron SAXS/WAXS beam line website ().SAXS data were analysed using Primus () from the ATSAS (; ) software suite (), which was used to plot the data and create Kratky plots. A Kratky plot, is a plot of Intensity (I) multiplied by the square of the scattering vector, , (defined as equal to 4&#x3C0;sin(&#x3B8;)/&#x3BB;, where 2&#x3B8; is the total scattering angle and &#x3BB; is the wavelength of the X-ray) against  ().Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells were maintained and passaged every 3&#x2013;4 days in PC12 media (F12K media containing 15% (v/v) horse serum, 2.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 &#xB5;g/ml streptomycin sulfate and 0.25 &#xB5;g/ml amphotericin B. The PC12 cells (passage 5&#x2013;15) were trypsinised (0.05% (w/v) trypsin/0.48 mM EDTA in PBS) and harvested in the maintenance media. The cells were centrifuged (400 &#xD7; g, 5 min) and the cell pellet was resuspended in F12K media containing 0.5% (v/v) FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 &#xB5;g/ml streptomycin sulfate and 0.25 &#xB5;g/ml amphotericin B). The centrifugation step was repeated and the cell pellet was resuspended in the media containing 0.5% (v/v) FBS with the addition of 100 ng/ml NGF. The cells were seeded at 5 &#xD7; 10 cells/well (100 &#xB5;l/well) into the inner 60 wells of a 96-well plate coated with poly-L-lysine. The outer 36 wells were used as a moat and were filled with sterile water (100 &#xB5;l/well). The cultures were maintained at 37&#xB0;C with 5%  in a humidified incubator (Heraeus Hera cell 150, Kendro Laboratory Products, Langenselbold, Germany) and allowed to differentiate for 96 h before treating with A&#x3B2;.The HFIP- or -treated peptide were prepared as described for the SAXS measurements, except 0.5 mg of A&#x3B2; was reconstituted using 60 mM NaOH, sterile water and 10 &#xD7; Dulbecco&#x2019;s PBS consisting of 1368.9 mM NaCl, 26.8 mM KCl, 63.9 mM , 14.7 mM , 9.0 mM  and 4.9 mM  () instead of the standard laboratory reagents. The resulting A&#x3B2; peptide was assessed for concentration as described for the SAXS measurements. This process resulted in A&#x3B2; stock solutions of 180&#x2013;250 &#xB5;M. The concentrated peptide was diluted into the cell culture media A (F12K, 0.5% FCS, 100 ng/ml NGF, 100 U/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 &#xB5;g/ml streptomycin sulfate and 0.25 &#xB5;g/ml amphotericin B) at no more than 1/10 so as not to affect the composition of the culture media. The vehicle was prepared in the culture media using the same dilution as the peptide. The media/vehicle was used to make subsequent dilutions of the peptide (10&#x2013;20 &#xB5;M). Cultures were also treated with the toxin control, staurosporine (1 &#xB5;M).The cultures were incubated and assessed for viability after 48, 72 and 96 h using the CCK-8 reagent. Five minutes prior to the assay, a second toxin control (0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100) was added to the designated cells. The viability assay was done by aspirating the treatment media and replacing with cell culture media A containing 10% of the CCK-8 reagent (100 &#xB5;l/well). The cultures were incubated for 2 h at 37&#xB0;C and then measured for absorbance changes on the LabSystems Multiskan MS multiplate reader (ThermoFisher Scientific, Scoresby, Australia) using a 405 nm filter. Wells containing CCK-8 reagent and no cells were used to measure the background absorbance of the CCK-8/media and the values were subtracted from the test data. The absorbance readings for the untreated cells were normalised to 100% to adjust for variation between control values of individual experiments and the test data were expressed as a proportion of the untreated cells. The normalised data represent the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) from 2&#x2013;4 experiments. The normalised comparisons and the results were taken to be significant when the  value was below 0.05. The ANOVA and comparisons were done in a Microsoft Office Excel spreadsheet.
