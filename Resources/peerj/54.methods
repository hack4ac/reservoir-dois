 describe a general lactation model consisting of a growth process multiplied by a death process and a scalar. They stipulate that both growth and death processes should be monotonic, with the growth function rising from zero to approach one, and the death function decreasing from one to approach zero. These constraints have the important effect of making the scalar largely responsible for magnitude of the curve with the growth function dominating shape of the rising portion of a normal lactation curve, and the death function dominating the decline in late lactation, or decay portion of the curve. Note that the growth function returns the cumulative growth as a function of time, not the  of growth. This may be inferred from the constraints. The multiplicative variant of the Pollot mechanistic model &#xA0;() follows this general model, but the frequently cited  lactation model, while otherwise similar to the general model, has no upper limit to the growth function, which results in the scaling of the lactation curve being shared between the scalar and the growth process.In developing the MilkBot model, we accept the constraints of the Rook general model and begin by extending it backwards, defining a , () which models the rate of creation of lactational capacity. This means the Growth function will be the integral of the Growthrate function, and Growthrate will be the derivative of Growth.  states the general model as defined, and extended, where () represents milk production on day  of a lactation with scalar  and (),&#xA0;(), and () representing growth, death, and Growthrate functions.  To maintain conformity with standard practices, the model&#x2019;s independent variable, , represents DIM, with &#xA0;=&#xA0;1 at parturition, but in a further extension of the general model, and contrary to current standard practice, we note that parturition and the start of lactation are separate events, though related. We define the start of lactation as the midpoint of growth in production capacity, and an  variable, , which is the time between parturition and that growth midpoint (the start of lactation). Therefore ()&#xA0;=&#xA0;1/2 when &#xA0;=&#xA0; by definition.Though () is not strictly a probability distribution, it is similarly constrained, with the full-range integral equal to 1. The most prominent probability distribution, the normal distribution, is an obvious candidate for (), which would require the rate of creation of udder capacity to rise in a bell curve to a peak near parturition, and then fall again. This has the advantage of being at least moderately credible in relation to observable growth of udder tissue, and easily described by two familiar parameters corresponding to the standard deviation of the Normal curve and the offset location parameter.The integral of the Normal distribution, the Cumulative Normal function, can only be calculated as an improper integral, which adds considerable mathematical complication. Therefore, simply as a concession to ease of computation, MilkBot uses an approximation, the Laplace distribution, for (), because it is easily integrated, while yielding a curve of similar shape. The Laplace distribution takes different mathematical forms for left and right sides of the curve, but since the peak is expected to be at or near parturition, and we are unconcerned with the shape of growth before milking commences, the left side of the function can safely be dropped (). This is equivalent mathematically to postulating that growth rate of udder capacity decreases exponentially from a peak that defines the start of lactation, and with enough high quality data it might be possible to discern whether an exponential or Gaussian growth rate function is closer to reality, but differences between the two are very small after the two weeks of lactation. The resulting growth function () ends up mathematically equivalent to the Mitscherlich function described by , but with a different parameterization which emphasizes similarity with the initial Gaussian model.   
               
            For a , (), we choose the same exponential decay function used by Wood, Rook, and others.  examined models for extended lactations and found that models featuring an exponential decline of this form outperformed other candidates for lactations exceeding 305 days in length.  Substitution of  and  in  yields the MilkBot Model. 
            Groups of 50 lactations each were drawn from 21 randomly selected dairy herds, and then compared to see whether herd effects influence lactation curve shape. Herds were selected from a large DHIA database of herds predominantly in the eastern half of the USA and containing monthly milk weights from more than six million lactations in over 17,000 herds. This is the same database used earlier for developing standard breed-parity aggregate curves&#xA0;(). Initial selection chose 1,056 herds with at least 1,000 recorded lactations between January 2005 and June 2008. From these, 21 herds were selected randomly. All data points after 305 DIM were dropped, then all lactations with fewer than 7 recorded monthly test days rejected. Lactations were divided in two parity groups, with all lactations after the first in a single group. Each group was then ordered by calving date and one lactation chosen randomly as a starting point. Lactations were then selected forward and backwards in time until 50 lactations had been collected. If a herd could not provide sufficient qualified lactations in either group, that herd was replaced by another randomly selected herd. This resulted in a set of 21 herds, each with 2 parity groups of 50 complete lactations having sequential calving dates. Lactations were all fitted using the DairySight fitting engine&#xA0;(), and parameter values recorded. Data for each herd-parity group was recorded as comma-delimited data in a single text file, then imported into Mathematica,Mathematica version 8.0.1.0 from Wolfram Research. which was used to generate tables and figures. The number of herds chosen was set to 21 because using the cutoff &#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;.05 in statistical testing leads to a 1/20 chance of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis. Therefore each herd could be compared to 20 others, with the expectation that on the average there would be one false-positive at &#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;.05 for each parameter compared. Greater differences suggest greater-than-random variability between herds.
