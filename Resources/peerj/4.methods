All  strains used in this study are derivatives of the clinical isolate AF293 () and are listed in . Strains were maintained on glucose minimal media (GMM) () and when appropriate the media was supplemented with 5&#xA0;mM uracil and 5&#xA0;mM uridine for  strains, 5&#xA0;mM arginine for  strains, and hygromycin was used at a final concentration of 100&#xA0;ug/ml. Radial growth experiments and 6-azauracil sensitivity assays were carried out essentially as in . All DNA manipulations were conducted according to standard protocols () and fungal transformation was done as previously described () with a minor modification of protoplasts being plated in 0.75% molten top agar. Primers used in this study are listed in .Strains used in this study.Primers used in this study.An &#xA0; disruption cassette was constructed using double-joint PCR consisting of the following: 1-kb DNA fragment upstream of the  start codon (primers Fbre5F and Fbre5R-RI), a 3-kb RI-III DNA fragment of  via pJW24 (), and a 1-kb DNA fragment downstream of the  stop codon (primers Fbre3F and Fbre3R-III). The fusion PCR product was then used to transform AF293.1 to prototrophy creating TJW84.1. Homologous single-gene replacement of  was confirmed by Southern analysis (). In order to complement the &#x394; mutant, a complementation plasmid (pJW109.5) was constructed. The plasmid contained a 3.8-kb wild-type  gene including a 1-kb native promoter and a 1-kb native termination cassette, which was amplified by primers FbreCOMF-NotI and FbreCOMR-SpeI. The PCR product was cloned into a  site of pUCH2-8 (), which contains the selectable marker hygromycin B phosphotransferase. TJW84.1 was transformed with pJW109.5 to hygromycin resistance and Southern blot confirmed single copy integration for TJW88.21 ().(A) A schematic drawn to scale illustrates the replacement of the  ORF with the  gene and the location of  restriction enzyme sites. (B) A radiolabeled probe consisting of the  ORF and &#x223C;1 kb on either side was used to probe a Southern blot of  digested genomic DNA. The expected banding pattern was observed. Confirmation of a complemented  strain (TJW88.21) was achieved via Southern blot using the described conditions above. An additional band is shown that is greater than 10 kb that is attributed to the random integration of the  complementing plasmid. (C)&#xA0;Schematic drawn to scale of the restriction enzyme cut sites in the wild type and &#x394; backgrounds. (D) Southern blot using a III digestion and a  double digestion using a radiolabeled probe consisting of the gene deletion construct shows the expected size differences between wild type and the &#x394; strains. (E) Complementation of the &#x394; mutant was confirmed using a  and subsequent III digestion to determine single integration of the complementing plasmid (TJMP29.1).An  disruption cassette was constructed by PCR amplifying a 1.1-kb DNA fragment upstream of the  ORF using the primer pair JP1 and JP2 containing RI restriction sites. The subsequent 1.1-kb RI-RI fragment was cloned into pJW24 to create pJMP1. A downstream 1.0-kb fragment was amplified using the primer pair JP3 and JP4 containing  and  restriction sites respectively. The 1.0-kb  fragment was cloned into pJMP1 to create the  disruption cassette named pJMP2. The  ORF was disrupted by transformation of linearized pJMP2 into AF293.6 creating the &#x394; auxotrophic strain (TJMP2.36), which was confirmed by Southern blot (). In order to generate a prototrophic deletion strain, an  complementation plasmid was constructed by amplifying a 2.6-kb fragment corresponding to  using the primer pair &#x2018;JP Afumi argB For&#x2019; and &#x2018;JP Afumi argB Rev&#x2019;, which was subsequently cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO (Invitrogen) to create pJMP4. This plasmid was transformed into TJMP2.36 to generate a prototrophic &#x394; strain (TJMP3.52). For complementation of &#x394;, a 4.6-kb fragment corresponding to &#x223C;0.9-kb up stream and &#x223C;0.5-kb downstream of the  ORF was amplified with the primer pair &#x2018;JP lsdA comp For&#x2019; and &#x2018;JP lsdA comp Rev&#x2019; each containing a  site. The subsequent  fragment was cloned into pJMP4 to create pJMP13. TJMP2.36 was transformed with pJMP13 to create a complemented control strain TJMP29.1 (&#x394;&#xA0; +&#xA0;) and single integration was confirmed by Southern blot ().Radial growth measurements and sensitivity to 6-azauracil (6AU) was conducted as described previously (). Four replicates were used for each assay and statistical significance was calculated with ANOVA analysis using Prism 5 software (Graph Pad).Nuclear extracts were isolated as previously described (). Approximately 50&#xA0;&#xB5;g of nuclear protein extract was electrophoresed on a 10% Tricine-SDS-PAGE gel () and subsequently electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Detection of H3K4 modifications was conducted using the following primary antibodies and dilutions: 1:1,000 anti- histone 3 (Upstate, #07-690), 1:1,000 anti-H3K4 mono-methylation (Upstate, #07-436), 1:2,000 anti-H3K4 di-methylation (Upstate, #07-030), 1:2,000 anti-H3K4 tri-methylation (Upstate, #07-473). Chemiluminescent detection was employed using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific) and a secondary goat anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase conjugate antibody (Pierce, #31460) diluted 1:15,0000 ().Western blot of nuclear protein extracts clearly indicate that  is required for proper methylation of H3K4. While H3K4 mono-methylation is unaffected by loss of , di-methylation is reduced and tri-methylation was absent. These data are consistent with &#xA0; null mutants. No difference in global methylation patterns of H3K4 was detected in the &#x394; strain compared to wild type.Fifty milliliter cultures of liquid GMM&#xA0;+&#xA0;0.1% yeast extract were inoculated with 1&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;10 spores per ml and incubated at 250 rpm 29&#x2009;&#xB0;C for 24&#xA0;h, followed by a reduction in temperature to 25&#x2009;&#xB0;C for an additional 48&#xA0;h. Mycelia were harvested, lyophilized overnight, and total RNA was extracted using Isol-RNA Lysis Reagent (5 Prime) according to manufacturers recommendations. Subsequent northern analysis was done using radiolabeled probes for the corresponding transcript () (primers are listed in ). Secondary metabolites were extracted from 20&#xA0;ml of culture filtrate with an equal volume of chloroform. The air-dried chloroform layer was resuspended in 75&#xA0;&#xB5;l chloroform and 5&#xA0;&#xB5;l was separated on a thin layer chromatography plate (Whatman, #4410 222) using chloroform: acetone (7:3) as a solvent. The TLC plate was then dried and imaged under 254&#xA0;nm and 366&#xA0;nm ultraviolet light (). Organic extracts from solid minimal medium cultures was accomplished by taking equal sized cores from the center of point-inoculated cultures, homogenized in 3&#xA0;ml of water, and extracted with an equal volume of chloroform. Quantification of TLC spots was achieved through densitometry analysis using Image J and normalized to wild type levels.The neutropenic murine model of aspergillosis was conducted as described previously () with approval of the William S. Middleton VA and the University of Wisconsin Animal Care Committees in accordance with the MV2344 animal use protocol. -deficient flies were generated by crossing flies carrying a thermosensitive allele of  (Tl r632) with flies carrying a null allele of  (Tl I-RXA) (). Two- to four day old adult female -deficient flies were used in all of the experiments. Twenty flies were infected with each  strain used in this study. All of the experiments were performed in triplicate. To minimize  rhythm variability, all experiments were performed at 9&#xA0;AM.  isolates were grown on yeast extract agar glucose (YAG) at 37&#x2009;&#xB0;C. Conidia were collected in sterile 0.9% saline from 2 days old cultures. The conidial concentration suspension was determined by using a hemacytometer and adjusted to 1&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;10&#xA0;per&#xA0;ml. The dorsal side of the thorax of twenty  anesthetized flies was punctured with a thin (10&#xA0;&#xB5;m) sterile needle that had been dipped in a concentrated solution of  conidia (10&#xA0;cells/ml). In our previous work, this method was shown to deliver a reproducible inoculum of 700 to 800 conidia (). As a negative control group, -deficient flies were punctured with a 10&#xA0;&#xB5;m sterile needle and monitored daily for survival. Flies that died within 3&#xA0;h of the injection were considered to have died as a result of the puncture procedure and were not included in the survival rate analysis. The flies were housed in a 29&#x2009;&#xB0;C incubator to maximize expression of the Tl r632 phenotype (). The -deficient flies were transferred into fresh vials every 3 days. Fly survival was assessed daily over 8&#xA0;days.
