We conducted our study of parasite establishment within an area where over 90% of estuarine marshes are heavily impacted due to decades of anthropogenic disturbances. Recent large-scale restoration projects with the goal to recreate &#x2018;pristine&#x2019; New-England type salt marshes, enhancing and creating a variety of marsh habitats for wildlife, have created spatially delineated habitats reflecting a gradient in time since restoration: Mill Creek Marsh (20 yr: 40&#xB0; 47&#x2032; 45&#x2033; N, 74&#xB0; 02&#x2032; 30&#x2033; W), Harrier Meadow (10 yr: 40&#xB0; 47&#x2032; 12&#x2033; N, 74&#xB0; 07&#x2032; 3&#x2033; W), Secaucus High School Marsh (0 yr: 40&#xB0; 48&#x2032; 17&#x2033; N, 74&#xB0; 02&#x2032; 52&#x2033; W), and Oritani Marsh (unrestored: 40&#xB0; 47&#x2032; 57&#x2033; N, 74&#xB0; 05&#x2032; 07&#x2033; W). Data on the free-living community and the construction of trophic food web networks has been previously described (; ).We use the parasite community of a focal species, the common marsh killifish , to assess the impact of community stability on parasite establishment. In our marshes, the host community (benthic invertebrates, birds, fishes) potentially transmit 11 species of helminth parasites to the common killifish (; ; ). We collected approximately 2000 fish from Kingsland Impoundment, a marsh area abutting our Harrier Meadow site. Upon capture, killifish were held in plastic cattle watering tanks (1.52 m in diameter and 0.61 m deep: containing &#x223C;1000 L of water pumped from Kingsland Impoundment) for 7 days. The killifish were subjected to a series of anthelminthic treatments for 5 consecutive days, with the addition of metronidazole, praziquantel, levamisole and piperazine in standard concentrations (). Following treatment, fish were held in recovery tanks for 2 days. Prior to stocking field cages at each site, 30 fish ( = 120 total necropsied) were removed from the recovery tank and dissected to ensure the treatment process was effective and establish a time zero parasite community value.Three cages (2.4 m long, 2.4 m wide, and 1.5 m deep) were placed in each of the four marsh sites. Each cage was made of plastic-coated galvanized wire panels with 1 cm mesh, this allowed for water flow and benthic macroinvertebrate colonization but excluded predators. Cages were placed in marsh sites two weeks prior to stocking. Following our fish treatment and recovery regime, we stocked each cage with 150 killifish. The resulting density (17 fish/m) was within the natural variation exhibited by local killifish populations. We placed the cages in water that ranged from 1.0 m&#x2013;1.5 m in depth; there was no halocline in the range in which the cages were placed. To eliminate the possibility that differences in cage placement or construction may affect the results, cage location within each marsh was determined randomly. Fish cages were sampled weekly for four weeks; at each sampling date 10 fish were removed from each cage ( = 30 per site each week). After the first 4 weeks, cages were sampled every two weeks ( = 30 per site) until cages were exhausted. Given prohibitive labor and time restrictions, a subsample of 15 fish were necropsied immediately after collection at each site. The fish were placed in a buffered 300 mg/L solution of tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222) until cessation of opercula movement, followed by pithing of the brain and spinal cord. The MS-222 solution, and all external surfaces were examined for ectoparasites using a stereomicroscope. The eyes and gills were removed and individually examined with each gill arch examined separately. The viscera were removed and internal body organs were examined using a stereomicroscope. All helminths were heat fixed and stored in 70% ethanol pending examination. Platyhelminths and acanthocephalans were stained with acetocarmine and mounted in Permount. Nematodes were fixed and stored in a mixture of 5% glycerol and 70% ethanol, and identified after approximately 2 wk. Helminth parasites collected during necropsy were identified using the keys of , ,  and primary literature ().Field collections were conducted under scientific permits issued by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, Division of Fish and Wildlife, Marine Fisheries Administration (#0558, #0628, #0746) and Bureau of Freshwater Fisheries (#0536, #06008, #07019). Fish euthanasia was in accordance with the 2000 Report of the American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia and approved by The Animal Care and Facilities Committee at Rutgers University (#00-012).To document parasite species richness, we used species accumulation curves (SACs) implemented using the bias-corrected Chao2 estimator in EstimateS 8.0.0 (). Sample order was randomized 100 times without replacement and mean species richness was estimated for each sample. We calculated the fit of the asymptotic Michaelis-Menten equation  =   /( + ), where  is observed richness,  is sample size,  is the asymptote or predicted richness and  is a measure of the rate at which the curve approaches the asymptote. A Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used on mean species richness to determine whether there were significant differences between sites; multiple pairwise comparison was conducted using Dunn&#x2019;s test.Food web stability was assessed using the framework provided by  and  and extended by . It is based on the concept of food web matrices and the dynamics of species densities in the network.  and  demonstrated that the community may be described via a matrix of interactions, and that a system will be locally stable if the eigenvalues of that matrix have negative real parts. Our approach for generating community matrices, and describing their characteristic eigenvalues is described in the .We also calculated the connectance of our food web matrices where connectance ( = /) is the number of realized links () divided by the number of possible links (). Measured in this way,  is the average fraction of species in a community consumed by the average species, i.e., when  = 0 no species consume each other and when  = 1 all species consume all other species and themselves. In order to allow for between network comparisons of connectance we normalized the data following the method of :  where   =  normalized connectance for  species;   =  connectance for  species; and   =  the minimum value of connectance for  species.
