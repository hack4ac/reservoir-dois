Flowers and buds of  were sampled from emergent inflorescences in the seed-based collections of private orchid growers. Reluctance to destroy individual plants dissuaded us from excavating early-stage inflorescences enclosed within the tubers in spring. Material preserved in 70% ethanol was processed for both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy (LM). For SEM, buds were removed from the inflorescence and dehydrated through an ethanol series to 100% ethanol. Samples were dried in a Tousimis Autosamdri 815B critical-point dryer (CPD) using carbon dioxide as the carrier gas. Flowers were mounted onto stubs using double-sided adhesive discs and dissected under a Wild Heerbrugg M7A microscope. Dissected samples were coated in platinum using an Emitech K550 sputter coater and imaged using a Hitachi S-4700 II cold-field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). Sections were prepared for light microscopy using Technovit 7100 resin. Sections were cut at  thickness using a Leica RM2155 microtome, mounted in water, dried and then stained with 0.5% (w/v) solution of toluidine blue. Coverslips were mounted using DPX mountant. Images were captured using a Zeiss Axiocam HRc camera attached to a Leica DMLB microscope.
