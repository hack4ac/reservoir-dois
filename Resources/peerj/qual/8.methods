The study was approved by the external, AAHRPP-accredited Ethical & Independent Review Services Institutional Review Board (E&I Review Document IRB-1-02.5). The protocol involved identifying within the 23andMe database BRCA mutation-positive customers who were at least 18 years of age, had consented to participate in research, and had chosen to view their results within the BRCA report. Before viewing their BRCA results, customers are encouraged to read written materials that provide information equivalent to that included in pre-test genetic counseling (Supplemental Information). Customers then can decide if they wish to see their results for these particular genes. Only individuals who had agreed to that step were invited to participate in this study. A control group of mutation-negative customers matched for age, sex and ancestry were also selected. Eligible participants were emailed an invitation that stated: “The study will involve a phone call about learning your results for specific tests: the three most common BRCA cancer mutations that predispose to the development of breast and ovarian cancer in females, and prostate cancer in males. You may or may not have one of these mutations”. Interested customers clicked on a button to learn more about the study and see the consent form. Those who agreed to participate were scheduled for a semi-structured phone interview by an experienced interviewer (CD) who did not know the BRCA status of the participants. Verbal consent was obtained from each research participant at the beginning of the phone interview.

Semi-structured Interview: During the interviews, we asked all participants whether they had been aware at the time of purchase that the 23andMe Personal Genome Service® (PGS®) included tests for high-impact BRCA mutations. Further questions fell into several categories: personal cancer history, family cancer history, how long they waited to view their report and whether they recalled their results. Failure to recall the results of the BRCA report resulted in termination of the interview. Those who remembered their results were then asked another series of questions: a rating of emotional response across six possible categories (including measures of surprise and anxiety or relief), perception of personal risk for breast, ovarian or prostate cancer, who they had shared their results with, and what actions they had taken or were planning to take. Lastly, we asked participants to identify their ethnic background and provide a retrospective assessment of their experience of obtaining their BRCA results online. The interview guide was tested for understandability and clarity by engaging several employees of 23andMe and collecting feedback. The interviewer was able to ask follow-up questions to clarify the meaning of any specific answer. The interviews were taped, coded and transcribed. At the conclusion of the interviews, the BRCA mutation status of each participant was verified from the 23andMe database.

Data analysis: A total of 29 themes were identified from the topics covered in the interview by the interviewer and first author who had reviewed the transcripts. Two other authors (AKK and BM) then independently read through and coded each transcript for the presence or absence, and other qualitative or quantitative parameters, of each of the identified themes. Agreement between the coders was quite high, over 95%, for the majority of themes. Themes that had lower agreement were: anxiety, actions taken by female relatives, perceived benefits of PGS testing, and discussion with a medical profession. The coders re-reviewed the transcripts where there were specific areas of disagreement and then, through discussion, decided on a final coding. The majority of initial disagreements resulted from coder error, lack of clarity on how to code reactions or actions taken in response to prior BRCA testing, lack of clarity on how to code actions that were planned but not yet taken, and interpretation of qualified responses to the perceived benefits of the product.
