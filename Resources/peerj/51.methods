Osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in &#x3B1;-MEM media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FBS) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (P/S), and maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 &#xB0;C with 5% . LPS from  (serotype 0111:B4, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was obtained from Sigma. p38 MAP kinase inhibitor VIII was purchased from EMD Biosciences (Gibbstown, NJ) and dissolved in DMSO for a stock concentration of 50 &#xB5;M. When used for cell treatment, a 1:5000 dilution was made to achieve a final working concentration of 10 &#xB5;M. For vehicle control, same dilution of DMSO (1:5000) was performed and then added to the medium.Neonatal mice calvarial osteoblasts were isolated from 3 days old mouse litters by dissection of the scalp skin and removal of the calvaria as described in a previous publication (). Calvaria were first incubated in &#x3B1;-MEM media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10,000 IU penicillin and 10,000 ug/mL streptomycin, and then incubated for 10 min in 4 mM  solution 3 times; the supernatants were discarded. The calvaria were then incubated twice at 37 &#xB0;C with 5%  in a freshly prepared collagenase type 2 solution containing NaCl, KCl, and  on an orbital shaker; the supernatants were discarded. Then, the digests from five sequential incubations with collagenase were pooled, centrifuged, and resuspended in &#x3B1;-MEM media supplemented with 10% FBS, 10,000 IU penicillin, and 10,000 ug/mL streptomycin. Cells were plated in 75 ml flasks. When 90% confluency was reached, the cells were passaged into 24 well-plates at a density of 4 &#xD7; 10 cells/well.Total cellular RNA were extracted from cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RNA concentration was determined by Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Wilmington, DE). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 &#xB5;g and 1 &#xB5;g total RNA from MC3T3-E1 and primary cells, respectively, using the Superscript II RNase  Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The data were normalized against glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which was used as a loading control. PCR was performed with primers for SOCS3: 5 primer, 5-AGCTCCAAAAGCGAGTACCA- 3 and 3 primer, 5-TGACGCTCAACGTGAAGAAG- 3; MMP-13: 5 primer, 5-TGGAGTGCCTGATGTGGGTGAATA- 3 and 3 primer, 5-TGGTGTCACATCAGACCAGACCTT- 3; GAPDH: 5 primer, 5-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG- 3 and 3 primer, 5-GGATGCAGGGATGATGTTC- 3. The fluorescence of the accumulated double-stranded products was monitored in real time. Gene expression was determined using the equation: &#x201C;relative expression&#x201D; = 2, where &#x394;Ct = Ct &#x2212; Ct.Construction, amplification, and titering of recombinant adenovirus containing mouse SOCS3 or siRNA for SOCS3 have been described previously (). Briefly, full-length mouse SOCS3 cDNA was first inserted into pDNR-CMV donor vector resulting in the production of pDNR-CMV-SOCS3, which has loxP sites both upstream and downstream of the SOCS3 expression cassette. SOCS3 expression cassette was then transferred from pDNR-CMV-SOCS3 to pLP-Adeno-X-CMV viral DNA using Cre-loxP recombination (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA), resulting in Adeno-SOCS3. To generate the virus, Adeno-SOCS3 was digested with PacI and transfected to HEK-293 cells according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Adenoviral siRNA for SOCS3 (Adeno-sh-SOCS3) was generated by Welgen under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Recombinant adenoviruses were purified by BD Adeno-X virus purification kit (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA). The viral stocks were tittered using Adeno-X Rapid Titer Kit (D Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA). MC3T3-E1 cells were grown to 90% confluence and infected with adenovirus (Adeno-Ctrl, Adeno-SOCS3, or Adeno-sh-SOCS3) at 100 multiplicity of infection (MOI). Cells were harvested for gene expression analysis after 48 h of transfection. In some groups, the cells were treated with LPS for 6 h prior to harvesting. Total RNA were isolated and reverse-transcribed into single-stranded cDNA for qRT-PCR analysis. In another experiment, MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with LPS for 0, 15, 30, and 60 min, respectively, prior to harvesting. Whole cell proteins were isolated for western blot analysis.The cells were lysed in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer (Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). Following protein extraction, total 80 &#xB5;g of proteins were used to perform electrophoresis in a 12% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane at 25 V for 60 min. Membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-SOCS3 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, 1:1000), rabbit anti-p38 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, 1:1000), or rabbit anti-p-p38 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, 1:1000), respectively at 4 &#xB0;C for overnight. After 3 sequential washes with TBS-T (0.1% Tween), the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG (Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, 1:3000) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence technique (Pierce, Indianapolis, IN).MC3T3-E1 cells were grown to 60&#x2013;80% confluence and then transfected with indicated DNA plasmids (0.5 &#xB5;g total) using Fugene 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) as instructed. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were either incubated with or without LPS for 4 h. Cell lysates were then collected and analyzed for luciferase activity by using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI).All data were analyzed using a One-Way ANOVA, and individual group means were then compared with a Newman-Keuls test.
