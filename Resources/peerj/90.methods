The study was performed in Anantapur, a district situated in Andhra Pradesh, India. In Anantapur, 72% of the population live in rural areas (), and there is a high prevalence of HIV infection in antenatal clinics (). The HIV epidemic is largely driven by heterosexual transmission and is characterized by poor socio-economic conditions and high levels of illiteracy in the HIV population (). HIV testing is offered free of cost in any of the 71 governmental integrated and counselling testing centres spread across the district, and it is also available in some private clinics. The Rural Development Trust (RDT) is a non-governmental organization that provides medical care to HIV infected people free of cost, including HIV testing, medicines, consultations or hospital admission charges. RDT has three hospitals in the district, and in one of them (Bathalapalli RDT Hospital) CD4 count enumeration and ART are provided free of cost by the Indian Government under a public-private partnership. The Vicente Ferrer HIV Cohort Study (VFHCS) is an open cohort study of all HIV infected patients who have attended RDT hospitals since June 2006. At enrolment in the cohort, the date of the first positive HIV testing is collected. The characteristics of the cohort have been described in detail elsewhere (). The cohort is fairly representative of the HIV population in the district as it covers approximately 70% of all HIV infected patients registered in the district ().For this study, we selected HIV infected adults (&gt;15 years) living in Anantapur and diagnosed with HIV between January 1st 2007 and November 4th 2011 that were included in the VFHCS. The selection of patients from the database was executed on September 14th 2012. Patients who were lost to follow up were actively searched for by at least one phone call and one home visit by outreach workers and for patients who had died, the date of death was collected.To describe the entry into HIV care, we calculated the time period between the HIV diagnosis and the first determination of the CD4 count. Following recommendations based on studies performed in sub-Saharan Africa (), delayed entry into care was defined if patients did not have a CD4 count measurement within three months of HIV diagnosis.In the analysis, patients&#x2019; communities were classified as &#x201C;socially disadvantaged&#x201D; if the patient self-reported living in a scheduled caste or scheduled tribe community. The &#x201C;socially disadvantaged&#x201D; designation was based on the fact that scheduled caste communities are marginalized in the traditional Hindu caste hierarchy and, therefore, suffer social and economic exclusion and disadvantage, and scheduled tribe communities are geographically isolated with limited economic and social contact with the rest of the population. These disadvantaged communities are supported by positive discrimination schemes operated by the Government of India (). Patients were considered to be living near an ART centre if they lived in a mandal with an ART centre or lived next to a mandal (administrative subdivision of districts in Andhra Pradesh; e.g., Anantapur District has 64 mandals) with an ART centre. ART centres are healthcare facilities able to perform CD4 count and provide ART to patients free of cost. During the study period, two mandals had an ART centre. Patients were considered to be living near a town when they lived in any of the six mandals containing a town with a population &gt;100,000 people. Towns have better communications than rural areas. Poverty was defined as living with less than 1000 Indian rupees per month (approximately 18 US dollars in March 2013). In Anantapur, distances between the headquarters of contiguous mandals can range between 10 to 30 km.
                
               value &lt;0.05. ART, antiretroviral therapy; aRR, adjusted risk ratio by Poisson regression with robust variance; CI, confidence interval.Statistical analysis was performed using Stata Statistical Software (Stata Corporation, Release 11, College Station, Texas, USA). We investigated factors associated with entry into care within three months of HIV diagnosis. All independent variables were included in the multivariable analysis. When variables had more than two groups, the group with the largest sample size was selected to avoid collinearity problems (). In order to find adjusted risk ratios that exhibit robustness to outliers, a Poisson regression with robust variance was applied (). All two-way interactions were checked, and we found interactions between gender and other variables. Hence, stratified-by-gender analysis was also performed. Missing values were imputed using multiple imputations by chained equation (). Cumulative incidence of entry into care and death was estimated using competing-risk regression (stcompet command in Stata) (; ).
