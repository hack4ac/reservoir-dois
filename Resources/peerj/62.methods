As Notostraca is known to contain cryptic species complexes (e.g. ), and in order to follow the same criterion for species selection for the multilocus analysis, we delimited species using a generalised mixed Yule coalescent (GMYC) model () fitted to an ultrametric phylogeny based on all available cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequences from GenBank. The 270 sequences were aligned with Muscle () and phylogeny estimated with BEAST v1.7.4 () under a constant population size coalescent tree model and GTR + &#x393; substitution model. A strict molecular clock was used with the substitution rate fixed to 1 to provide branch lengths relative to an arbitrary time scale. The MCMC chain was run for 9,000,000 iterations with the first 500,000 iterations removed as burnin. Effective sample sizes (ESS&#x2019;s) of parameters (all greater than 200) and appropriate burnin were checked using Tracer v1.5 (). From this a maximum clade credibility tree using median heights was made. We then fitted a single threshold GMYC model to the COI tree to delimit species from populations. A total of 34 species of Notostraca were identified in this analysis ().We constructed a multilocus alignment containing representatives of all known species of Notostraca. Single representatives of each phylogenetic species identified by the GMYC analysis were selected for inclusion in our phylogenetic analysis. In addition, four Notostraca lineages  and ), which did not have COI data available, but were represented by other genes, were also used in our multilocus phylogenetic analysis. The species status of these lineages has been confirmed in regional studies of cryptic diversity (; ; ; ). We also included seven representatives of the other branchiopod orders so that robust fossil calibrations could be applied for the dating analysis. We included sequences for the genes 12S, 16S, 28S, cytochrome oxidase I (COI), Elongation Factor 1-alpha (EF1), RNA Polymerase II and Glycogen Synthase (see  for Accession Numbers).Sequences were aligned using MUSCLE () with final adjustments by eye. Introns in the nuclear protein coding genes were identified and removed based on alignment with available Notostraca mRNAs. Translation was checked in MEGA 5 (). Overall, sequences for 45 taxa (38 notostracan and 7 branchiopod outgroups) were concatenated for analysis with the alignment containing 5793 positions and 52% missing data (; the alignment file is available in Dryad ).Optimum partitioning schemes and substitution models for our phylogenetic analysis and divergence time estimation were identified using PartitionFinder (). PartitionFinder uses a heuristic search algorithm, starting with a fully partitioned analysis (gene and codon position where appropriate), and identifies the best fit partitioning scheme and substitution models based on Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Due to the restricted model choice available in RAxML () we conducted separate PartitionFinder analyses for the phylogenetic analysis and divergence time estimation. For the phylogenetic analysis we restricted model choice options to GTR or GTR + &#x393;, whereas for divergence time estimation we allowed models to be selected from the full suite available in BEAST. We excluded models with proportion of invariant sites (+I) as rate heterogeneity is accounted for by the gamma shape parameter ( + &#x393;). Optimum partitioning schemes and substitution models for both analyses are given in  and .Branchiopod phylogeny was estimated using Bayesian and maximum likelihood (ML) methods with partitions and substitution models set to those identified by PartitionFinder (). Bayesian analysis was performed with MrBayes v3.2 (). Model parameters between partitions were unlinked. Two independent MCMC chains were run for 10,000,000 iterations each, sampling every 5,000 iterations. The first 25% of each run was discarded as burnin with the remaining samples pooled and used to create a maximum clade credibility tree. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis was performed using RAxMLHPC-PTHREADS v7.0.4 (). An initial ML search using GTR + &#x393; was performed onto which 100 rapid bootstraps were drawn.We estimated Bayesian divergence times with BEAST v1.7.4 () using an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock () and a Yule speciation prior. XML files for all BEAST runs were created using BEAUTi v1.7.4 (). Topology was constrained to that of the unconstrained RAxML analysis. We used the best fit partitioning scheme identified by PartitionFinder () and estimated substitution model parameters independently for each partition. Initial runs were conducted using substitution models identified by PartitionFinder, however, this resulted in poor mixing of some GTR model parameters for partitions 1, 2 and 5, so subsequent runs were performed using a simpler HKY + &#x393; model for these partitions.Age constraints are treated as hard bounds unless otherwise stated. Node numbers indicate phylogenetic placement of fossil calibrations in .Five branchiopod fossils representing the oldest known occurrences of their respective crown groups were used to calibrate the molecular clock with minimum age constraints (). Lognormal prior distributions were used to specify the level of uncertainty in the placement of these fossil calibrations as they reflect the likely scenario that the true date of divergence of a given node was some time before the earliest known fossil belonging to that clade (). Lognormal distributions have three parameters &#x2013; mean, standard deviation and offset. We set the offset to correspond to the minimum age of the node as determined by the fossil record, we then specified mean and standard deviations that resulted in 95% of the distribution falling between the age of the fossil and the age of the next oldest fossil (at a lower taxonomic level) for that group. This gives a prior distribution, which assigns the majority of the probability close to the age of the oldest known fossil, but gives a long tail to account for uncertainty in the proximity of the fossil to the true date of divergence. As Bayesian divergence dating benefits from at least one maximum age constraint we conservatively constrained the root of the tree to a maximum age of 558 Mya, the age of the oldest bilaterian fossil ().We ran two independent BEAST MCMC chains for 50,000,000 iterations, sampling every 5000 iterations. Ten million iterations were removed as burnin from each run. Convergence of the two runs and the ESS of parameter estimates (all greater than 250) where assessed using Tracer v1.5 (). A posterior sample of 8000 trees from one of the runs was used to construct a maximum clade credibility time tree for Notostraca and our selected outgroups. The XML file used to run the BEAST divergence time analysis can be downloaded from Dryad .Patterns of diversification through time within Notostraca were investigated using LASER () based on the BEAST time tree with outgroups pruned. Using LASER we compared constant rate and variable rate speciation models using likelihood ratio tests ().
