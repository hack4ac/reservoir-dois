This was a prospective, observational study designed to explore relationships and differences between the WBFS to and the SCF during venipuncture in children 5&#x2013;16 years old.This analytical, observational study was undertaken in the Day Hospital of the Pediatric Specialist and Laboratory Analysis Service of the Children Hospital &#x201C;Regina Margherita&#x201D; (Turin, Italy). It was conducted between March 2010 and March (inclusive) 2011 and in accordance with good clinical practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Azienda Ospedaliera, OIRM S. Anna &#x2013; Ospedale Mauriziano (Turin, Italy).We know that WBFS and SCF values are hardly to compare, but we decided to use a conversion table provided by the developer of SCF tool which made possible to convert the SCF values in a graded scale from zero to ten similar to WBFS grades.A convenience sample of pediatric patients (5&#x2013;16 years old) was enrolled: eligible patients were children or adolescents candidates for venipuncture for the collection of diagnostic blood specimens for routine hematological testing. All the patients were recruited at the &#x201C;Regina Margherita&#x201D; Children Hospital: some were recruited in the outpatient clinic and others were enrolled in Day Hospital, where they were followed for previous gastrointestinal diseases,&#xA0;endocrine disorders or diabetes&#xA0;mellitus&#xA0;type I. Children with known cognitive impairments, developmental delays, sensory deficits, pathological conditions of the palm and children receiving analgesic drugs were excluded from the study. Written consent was obtained from the parents, and verbal assent was obtained from each child or adolescent, adequately&#xA0;informed about the&#xA0;purpose&#xA0;of the study and&#xA0;the tools used. Parents were informed that their acceptance or refusal of the study would not affect clinical service. Basic demographic data (age, gender, previous diseases) were recorded. All the eligible children had to be subjected to venipuncture according to a previous clinical prescriptions in order to obtain diagnostic information.All the venipunctures for the collection of blood were performed in the same setting with the same environmental temperature and by the same person. In our hospital nonpharmacologic distraction techniques are routinely perfomed: for venipuncture all the subjects received parental holding and positioning.
