For transfection experiments and expression in , mouse Tmod2 (accession No. NM_016711) was subcloned into pReceiver-M55 with mCherry tag and into pReceiver-B01 with His-tag (Genecopoeia, Rockville, MD), respectively. The plasmid for mouse Tmod1 (accession No. NM_21883) subcloned into pEGFP-C1 was a generous gift from Dr. Carol Gregorio (Arizona State University) previously used in (). The GFP-Tmod1 plasmid was used both for PC12 transfection and as a template for mutagenesis. The pET(His)Tmod1 plasmid () was used for Tmod1 expression in  and as a template for mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The plasmids were amplified by PCR according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions with the modification described in () using Pfu Ultra Hotstart DNA polymerase (Agilent) and two complementary sets of oligonucleotides, which contain changed triplets.To change Ala 21 to Lys in chicken or mouse Tmod1, the sets of oligonucleotides were 5&#x2032;-GAA GAC AAG ATC CTC GGA AAG CTG ACG GAG GAA GAG CTC-3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032;-GAG CTC TTC CTC CGT CAG CTT TCC GAG GAT CTT GTC TTC-3&#x2032;; or 5&#x2032;-GAG GAT GAA ATC CTG GGG AAG CTC ACA GAG GAG GAG C-3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032;-GCT CCT CCT CTG TGA GCT TCC CCA GGA TTT CAT CCT C-3&#x2032;, respectively.Then once a single mutation was introduced and confirmed for each plasmid, the singly-mutated plasmid was then used as a template to introduce the second mutation.To change Glu 33 to Val in chicken or mouse Tmod1, the sets of oligonucleotides were: 5&#x2032;-CTC AGG AAG TTG GAG AAC GTG CTG GAA GAG CTG GAC-3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032;-GTC CAG CTC TTC CAG CAC GTT CTC CAA CTT CCT GAG-3&#x2032;, or 5&#x2032;-CTG AGG ACG CTG GAA AAT GTG CTA GAT GAA CTA GAC-3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032;-GTC TAG TTC A TCT AGC ACA TTT TCC AGC GTC CTC AG-3&#x2032;, respectively.After PCR, the original plasmid was digested using DpnI. The digest was used to transform  maximum-efficiency DH5&#x3B1; (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in the presence of 100 mg/L carbenicillin for all plasmids except the one for GFP-Tmod1, which was grown in the presence of 50 mg/L kanamycin. After plasmid purification (using Qiagen mini-prep kit), the presence of mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Synthesis of all oligonucleotides was done by Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. (Coralville, Iowa), and DNA sequencing was done by Genewiz (South Plainfield, NJ).Tmod1 (both wild type and mutant) was overexpressed in  BL21 (DE3) pLysE while Tmod2 was overexpressed in  BL21 (DE3). Auto-inducible ZYP-5052 media () containing 100 mg/L carbenicillin (plus 50 mg/L chloramphenicol for  BL21 (DE3) pLysE) was inoculated and cells were grown for 12&#x2013;15 hours at 37&#xA0;&#xB0;C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm (Sorvall SLA-3000 Rotor), 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C, for 10&#xA0;min. Pellets were re-suspended in 20 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), containing 1 mM pefabloc, and 1 mM tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK). Re-suspended pellets were sonicated for 10 min on ice. The homogenized solution was then centrifuged at 20,000 rpm (Sorvall SA-300 Rotor), 4 &#xB0;C, for 20 minutes and the supernatant was loaded onto a Superflow Ni-NTA agarose column (Qiagen) equilibrated with 50 mM Na-phosphate, pH&#xA0;6.8, containing 10 mM imidazole. Once the protein was loaded, the column was washed with 50 mM Na-phosphate, pH&#xA0;6.8, containing 10 mM imidazole and 5 mM &#x3B2;-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were eluted by a 50&#x2013;250 mM imidazole gradient in the same buffer. Fractions containing Tmod were combined, dialyzed overnight against 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT, and loaded on an anion-exchange column Poros HQ/L (PerSeptive Biosystems) using an FPLC system (Pharmacia). Proteins were eluted by a 12&#x2013;25% (for Tmod1) or 10-30% (for Tmod2) NaCl gradient. Fractions containing Tmod were combined and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 1mM EDTA and 1mM DTT. Protein purity was evaluated using SDS-PAGE.N-acetylated TM peptides (&#x3B1;Tm1bzip, &#x3B3;Tm1bzip, and &#x3B4;Tm1bzip) were synthesized by the Tufts University Core Facility (Boston, MA). Chimeric TM peptides designed for structural and functional studies (; ; ) contain 19 N-terminal residues of short &#x3B1;-, &#x3B3;-, or &#x3B4;-TM respectively, encoded by exon 1b. To stabilize the coiled-coil structure, each peptide contained an additional 18 C-terminal residues of the GCN4 leucine Zipper domain. Quality of the synthetic peptides was confirmed using mass spectroscopy; molecular weights of the peptides were the same as the predicted ones.Isoelectric points of TM peptides were calculated using protparam . Concentrations of proteins and peptides were determined both by using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and by measuring their difference spectra in 6 M guanidine-HCl between pH 12.5 and 7.0, using the extinction coefficients of 2357 per tyrosine and 830 per tryptophan at 294 nm as in (). Standard deviations of concentrations determined by the two methods were 20% for Tmod2 and between 4 and 16% for TM peptides.Binding was detected using native gel electrophoresis in 9% polyacrylamide gels that were polymerized in the presence of 10% glycerol without SDS. To prepare complexes for loading onto gels, stock solutions of 12&#xA0;&#xB5;M Tmods were mixed with TM peptides in a 1:2 molar ratio in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA. Presence (&#xA0;&#x2264;&#xA0;100 mM) or absence of NaCl did not affect binding results. Sample loading buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 40% glycerol, 0.01% bromophenol blue) was added to the samples to a Tmod final concentration of 7.5&#xA0;&#xB5;M. Running buffer for electrophoresis contained 25 mM Tris-HCl and 192 mM glycine. For titration, TM peptides were added at different ratios (up to 3:1) to the stock solution of Tmod2. Samples were analyzed by staining native polyacrylamide gels with Coomassie R-250 and quantified using a ChemiDoc XRS+ with Image Lab Software (BioRad). Density of the complex bands was normalized in order to average results of several titrations.Undifferentiated PC12 cells were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen) and 10% horse serum (HS, Invitrogen), and were sub-cultured every three days. For neuronal differentiation, PC12 cells were grown on 100&#xA0;&#xB5;g/ml poly-D-lysine&#x2013;coated 8-well plates or 35-mm culture dishes (ibidi LLC) in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS, 1% HS, and 100 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF, invitrogen). PC12 cells were transfected with GFP-Tmod1 WT, GFP-Tmod1 A21K/E33V, mChFP-Tmod2, or GFP-actin using lipofectamin 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Twenty-four hours after transfection, neuronal differentiation was induced and neurite outgrowth was monitored on day 3 and day 6 on a laser scanning confocal microscope LSM710 (Zeiss) with a 63x oil immersion lens (Zeiss). Images were acquired with Zen software (Zeiss) and the number and length of neurites were analyzed in Imaris software (Bitplane). Statistical analysis was performed by One-way ANOVA.
