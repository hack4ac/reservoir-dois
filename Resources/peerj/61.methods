Male Sprague-Dawley rats (p21-35) were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, i.p.) in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use and National Institutes of Health Guidelines and under the guidance and approval of the IACUC Committee of the Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Center. Transcardial perfusion was performed with &#x223C; 15 ml of ice-cold sucrose-aCSF (in mM: 75 sucrose, 87 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 , 7 , 0.5 , 25 , 1 ascorbic acid) saturated with 95%  and 5% . The brain was rapidly removed and coronal slices (300 &#xB5;m) were cut in this same sucrose-aCSF. Slices were transferred to the recovery chamber containing aCSF (in mM: 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 , 1.2 , 2.4 , 18 , 11 glucose, with pH 7.2&#x2013;7.4 and mOsm 304-306) at 31 &#xB0;C and saturated with 95%  and 5% . 1 mM ascorbic acid was added to the aCSF in the recovery chamber just before adding the slices. Slices were incubated for 30 min-5 h prior to recordings.Whole-cell current-clamp recordings were made from NAshell medium spiny neurons, identified as previously described (). Patch-clamping was performed as described (; ) using 3&#x2013;5 M&#x3A9; glass electrodes filled with a potassium methanesulfonate-based internal solution (130 mM KOH, 105 mM methanesulfonic acid, 17 mM hydrochloric acid, 20 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM EGTA, 2.8 mM NaCl, 2.5 mg/ml MgATP, 0.25 mg/ml NaGTP, pH 7.2&#x2013;7.4, 275&#x2013;285 mOsm). Patch-clamp data were collected at 15 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz using Clampex 9.2 or 10 and a Multiclamp 700A patch amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). During electrophysiology experiments, slices were submerged and continuously perfused (using a peristaltic pump, &#x223C;2.5 ml/min) with carbogen-bubbled aCSF warmed to 31&#x2013;32 &#xB0;C, and supplemented with DNQX (10 &#xB5;M, to block AMPA receptors) and picrotoxin (50 &#xB5;M, to block GABA-A receptors). Here, we decided to use a concentration of 2 &#xB5;M &#x3B1;-flupenthixol, a D1/D2 receptor antagonist. Previous reports have reported divergent concentrations of &#x3B1;-flupenthixol in slice experiments (10 &#xB5;M in , 0.1 &#xB5;M in ). Also, behavioral experiments injecting &#x3B1;-flupenthixol into the NAcb tend to use higher concentrations (&#x2265;5 &#xB5;g, ; ) relative to that used for SCH23390 or raclopride (1&#x2013;2 &#xB5;g, see ). Thus, we chose 2 &#xB5;M, which is somewhat higher than the 1 &#xB5;M we use for SCH23390 and raclopride . In addition, &#x3B1;-flupenthixol had no effect of firing on its own (, &#x2212;0.3 &#xB1; 2.3% change in firing versus basal,  = 0.116 paired -test), in agreement with our previous studies that blockers more selective for D1 or D2 receptors have no effect on firing on their own in the NAshell ().(A, B) (A) Example traces and (B) grouped data across time showing that 1 &#xB5;M MCH (MCH) and 3 &#xB5;M apomorphine (Apo3) interact to enhance firing in NAshell neurons , while 3 &#xB5;M apomorphine had no effect alone. (C) 10 &#xB5;M apomorphine (Apo10) was sufficient to enhance NAshell firing. (D) 1 &#xB5;M MCH in combination with 1 &#xB5;M apomorphine did not increase firing. (E) 1 &#xB5;M MCH in combination with 10 &#xB5;M apomorphine significantly increased firing. (F) 3 &#xB5;M apomorphine in combination with 1 &#xB5;M MCH significantly enhanced firing under conditions where AMPA and GABA receptors were not blocked. (G) 3 &#xB5;M apomorphine + 1 &#xB5;M MCH did not increase firing when the PKA inhibitor peptide PKI (20 &#xB5;M) was included in the intracellular pipette.Enhancement of NAshell firing by MCH (1 &#xB5;M) + apomorphine (3 &#xB5;M) was prevented by pre-exposure to (A) the DA1 receptor blocker SCH23390 (SCH, 1 &#xB5;M), (B) the DA2 receptor blocker raclopride (Racl, 1 &#xB5;M), (C) the D1/D2 blocker &#x3B1;-flupenthixol (flupen, 2 &#xB5;M), or (D) the MCH receptor blocker TPI (2 &#xB5;M).The resting membrane potential was determined just after breaking into a neuron, and each neuron was then brought to a resting potential of &#x223C;&#x2212;85 mV by passage of DC current via the patch amplifier before further firing experiments. To generate APs, neurons in current clamp were depolarized with a series of 7 or 8 500-ms current pulses, with 20 pA between each current pulse, and where the initial current pulse for each neuron was just sub-threshold for firing. This series of current pulses was applied every 30 s throughout the experiment, and was alternated with hyperpolarizing steps (&#x2212;50 and &#x2212;100 pA) to examine input resistance.To analyze changes in firing for each cell, a depolarizing step was chosen that gave &#x223C;6&#x2013;7 APs in the basal condition. We then determined the number of APs at this current step at all time points during the experiment for that cell. The baseline firing rate was determined from the average of firing in the 4 min before addition of apomorphine &#xB1; MCH, and was normalized to 100% for each cell. The percent change in firing versus baseline was then determined by taking the average of firing during the 6th&#x2013;8th min of apomorphine &#xB1; MCH exposure. Statistics across groups were determined using these averaged values for the peak change in firing. Thus, a one-way ANOVA was calculated comparing 3 &#xB5;M apomorphine + MCH with and without dopamine or MCH receptor blockers, and also comparing with 3 &#xB5;M apomorphine alone; Tukey was used as a post-hoc.  &lt; 0.05 was taken to indicate significant differences. Data are shown as mean + /&#x2212; SEM.
