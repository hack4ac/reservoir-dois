EHS was diagnosed based on the following three clinical items in central nervous system hypersomnias: (i) recurrent daytime sleep episodes that occur basically everyday over a period of at least 6 months; (ii) absence of cataplexy; (iii) the hypersomnia is not better explained by another sleep disorder, medical or neurological disorder, mental disorder, medication use or substance use disorder (; ; ; ). We focused our studies on patient with EHS, but lacking , because previous studies (; ; ) indicated that  negative EHS is essentially different from HLA-positive EHS and narcolepsy with cataplexy. In this GWAS, we recruited 125 individuals who were given a diagnosis of EHS at a clinic affiliated with Neuropsychiatric Research Institute of Japan and 562 Japanese individuals as healthy controls. All genomic DNA samples were genotyped using Affymetrix Genome-Wide SNP Array 6.0 platform. In order to validate the accuracy of the top SNPs from the Affymetrix Genome-Wide SNP Array 6.0 platform, three SNPs (rs11854769, rs12471007 and rs10988217) were genotyped by TaqMan assay.In order to elucidate the effects of susceptibility SNPs found in Japanese EHS GWAS samples in other population, a collaboration study with the Center for Narcolepsy, Stanford University School of Medicine, was carried out. The comparative study of a Caucasian population focused on patients with 268 -negative hypersomnias and 1761 -negative healthy controls. All subjects had given written informed consent for their participation in these studies in accordance with the process approved by ethics committees of the University of Tokyo and Stanford University. genotyping for EHS samples were performed using Luminex Multi-Analyte Profiling System (xMAP) together with the WAKFlow HLA typing kit (Wakunaga, Hiroshima, Japan). Briefly, target DNA was amplified by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) with biotinylated primers. The PCR amplicon was then denatured and hybridized to complementary oligonucleotide probes immobilized on fluorescent coded microsphere beads. In the meantime, biotinylated PCR products were labeled with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin, and finally HLA typing was examined by Luminex 100 (Luminex, Austin, TX).Genotype calling was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console 4.0, which employs the Birdseed genotype calling algorithm for Affy 6.0 ( = 687). Samples with a low quality control call rate (typically &lt;95%) were excluded before performing the full clustering analysis of genotypes. For each Birdseed genotype call, SNPs with call rates &lt;99%, SNP that shown deviation from Hardy-Weinberg ( &lt; 0.001) in controls, monomorphic SNP, and sex-chromosome SNPs were excluded from subsequent analysis. Cluster plots of the top 100 SNPs that showed the strongest association were checked visually and ambiguously clustered SNPs were excluded; only one SNP was excluded based on this cluster criterion. In the absent of independent Japanese EHS samples for replication, we validated the accuracy of randomly selected SNPs genotyped by Affymetrix 6.0 platform using a TaqMan assay.Association analysis of SNPs were analyzed using an allelic model, a dominant model, a recessive model, or a Cochran&#x2013;Armitage trend test using PLINK (v1.07) (). Population stratification within the Japanese patients with EHS was evaluated based on the genomic inflation factor (&#x3BB;), which was calculated from the median of the Cochran&#x2013;Armitage trend test. The quantile-quantile (Q&#x2013;Q) plot was plotted with expected distribution of association test statistics under null distribution across the Cochran&#x2013;Armitage trend observed -values with  statistical environment version 2.9.0. Peta odd ratio was used to calculate odd ratio for any contingency column with counting of 0, online calculator is available at . Manhattan-plot was generated using Haploview (v4.1) (). For the Caucasian comparative study, an allelic, a dominant, and a recessive model were each assessed using a 2-tailed chi-square test. The eQTL analyses were performed based on data from the Sanger Institute GENEVAR project (); these data are based on three cell types (fibroblast, lymphoblastoid cell line and T-cell) of 75 unrelated Western European origin individuals (). The SNPExpress Database (), which is based on 93 autopsy-collected cortical brain tissue with no defined neuropsychiatric condition and 80 peripheral blood mononucleated cell (PMBC) samples collected from healthy donors, was also used as a reference for eQTL analyses. Relationships between the genotypes of candidate loci and the expression levels of nearby genes and transcripts were also examined.MACH version 1.0 () was used to estimate haplotypes, map crossover and error rates using 50 iterations of the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. By employing genotype information from HapMap Phase II (release 23) database (), maximum likelihood genotypes were generated. For the quality control of the imputed genotypes, imputed genotypes with the estimated 2 &gt; 0.3 were retained. Imputed genotypes were re-analyzed by allelic, dominant, and recessive models and the Cochran&#x2013;Armitage trend test utilizing PLINK 1.7. Regional association plots were generated using LocusZoom ().
