The neurodegenerative diseases we selected were Parkinson&#x2019;s (PD), Alzheimer&#x2019;s (AD), Huntington&#x2019;s (HD), Wilson&#x2019;s (WD), and Gaucher&#x2019;s (GD). The congenital Down syndrome (DS), well known for a history of lability in its nomenclature, was chosen as a reference for comparison. We adapted a publicly available script (), running within the open source R statistical environment (), to make automated queries of the PubMed database. We extracted a count of the titles of published articles which contained the possessive or non-possessive form of each name (for example, &#x201C;Parkinson&#x2019;s disease&#x201D; vs &#x201C;Parkinson disease&#x201D;), for each year from 1960&#x2013;2012. The outcome measure was the percentage of papers which used the possessive form, calculated for each disorder within each year. Non-eponymous alternatives (such as hepatolenticular degeneration, trisomy 21) were not considered. Searches for HD and AD included &#x201C;chorea&#x201D; and &#x201C;dementia&#x201D; respectively as alternatives to &#x201C;disease&#x201D;. An example pair of queries is &#x201C;Huntington&#x2019;s disease[TITLE] OR Huntington&#x2019;s chorea[TITLE]&#x201D; vs &#x201C;Huntington disease[TITLE] OR Huntington chorea[TITLE]&#x201D;. To avoid the double-counting of papers which were initially published electronically but subsequently appeared in print in the following calendar year, the date was specified using the Print Dates Only Tag [PPDAT] rather than Publication Date [DP] (). Queries were intentionally limited to a rate of less than 3 per second to comply with current PubMed guidelines for automated access. The dataset, obtained on 25 January 2013, took approximately 11 min to collect. The R script used to obtain the data, and the resulting dataset itself, are available in the .We then investigated how patterns vary across a number of prominent primary research journals. Because the number of papers published annually on a given disorder in a particular journal is usually small, we restricted the analysis to the two most frequently published disorders (Parkinson&#x2019;s and Alzheimer&#x2019;s) to reduce instability in the proportion measure. Their results were strikingly similar and for clarity we present only the Parkinson&#x2019;s findings. We restricted the data collection to each of selected general neurology journals published either in the United Kingdom  or the United States , because different national practices have been noted previously (). We also assessed , the official journal of the international Movement Disorder Society. As a specialist journal, it publishes more Parkinson&#x2019;s-titled papers than these general journals combined (in 2012, 176 papers vs 127).No ethical approval was either sought or required for this study as it involved only publicly-available data.
