 were reared at 25 &#xB0;C under a 12 h light-dark cycle on standard yeast-sugar-cornmeal media. Wandering third-instar larvae were used for all experiments.  larvae were used as wild-type (WT) control. The  mutant line,    (hereafter referred to as ), was obtained from Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (Stock No. 4587). The UAS- RNAi line was obtained from Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center (Transformant ID: 6723). Expression of RNAi was restricted using the RRA-GAL4 driver () to two identified MNs: (1) the MN innervating muscle 1 with big terminal boutons of Type I (glutamatergic), known as MN1-Ib, and (2) the MN innervating dorsal muscles, including muscle 1, via the intersegmental nerve (ISN) with small Type I terminal boutons, known as MNISN-Is (). MN1-Ib and MNISN-Is are also known by their embryonic identities as aCC and RP2, respectively (). The RRA-GAL4 driver line (obtained from Subhashini Srinivasan) included a Dicer construct (UAS-Dicer/Cyo;RRA-GAL4, UAS-cd8 GFP/RRA-GAL4) to increase the strength of the RNAi ().Larvae were dissected and recorded in HL3.1 saline () containing (in mM): 70 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.5 , 4 , 10 , 5 Trehalose, 115 Sucrose, 5 HEPES, pH 7.1-7.3. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, Missouri). Previous electrophysiological studies of  larvae have used a dissection method which involves cutting up the dorsal midline (; ; ; ; ; ). However, since reliable access to intact dorsal-most body wall muscles 1 and 2 () was required for experiments, a new dissection method was developed in which these muscles did not risk damage from cutting down the midline or pinning. Larvae were pinned at the head and tail in silicone elastomer (Sylgard)-lined dishes. A cut was made to the right of the dorsal midline, typically through muscle 4 (), which left all muscles and axons on one side of the larva intact for recording. The opposite side suffered damage to the muscles through which the cut was made. In addition, the peripheral nerves which lie in the muscle field were cut as a result of the incision, leaving many of the muscles in the dorsal group on the cut side without functional innervation. All organs and fat bodies were removed to allow access to the muscles. Larvae dissected with this method generated rhythmic peristaltic waves similar to those recorded from larvae dissected up the midline, except for an acceleration of the rhythm (see ). This new larval preparation is referred to herein as the &#x2018;off-midline dissection&#x2019; ().A cut (dashed line) was made to the right of the midline near muscle 4. Larvae were pinned and cleaned so that the muscles (rectangles) and the central nervous system (solid black) were exposed. Muscles 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 and abdominal segments A5&#x2013;A7 are labeled. For clarity, not all muscles, segments, or nerves are pictured.Intracellular recordings were made at room temperature (21&#x2013;23 &#xB0;C) from dorsal muscles 1 or 2 in abdominal segments 2&#x2013;6, as described previously by others (; ). In the majority of experiments, muscles in two adjacent segments were simultaneously recorded, while in a few experiments muscle activity from only one segment was recorded. Sharp electrodes were pulled from thin-walled borosilicate glass on a P-87 Flaming/Brown filament puller (Sutter Instrument Co.) to a resistance of 30&#x2013;50 M&#x3A9;. Using a long and flexible tip was crucial for allowing the electrode to move with the muscle during peristaltic waves of contractions. Electrodes were filled with 3 M KCl or KAc for recording. Recordings were made with an Axoclamp 2B amplifier (Molecular Devices) in bridge mode and digitized at a sampling rate of 10 kHz by a Digidata 1320A (Axon Instruments). Data were stored using PClamp 8.2 (Molecular Devices) and imported into Spike2 (Cambridge Electronic Design).Preparations were observed through an Olympus BX51WI microscope. The incidence of visible peristaltic waves, including the direction of the waves, was noted manually and marked with electronic timestamps to restrict analysis to these bouts. Activity such as tonic firing, or bursts of action potentials not associated with peristaltic waves, was not included in the analysis. The following criteria had to be met for a preparation to be considered : (1) at least 3 spontaneous and consecutive posterior (P) to anterior (A) or A to P waves were recorded, (2) the minimum frequency of the activity was 3 bursts per minute, and (3) the bout was at least 1 min in duration; bursts occurring more than 1 min apart were considered to belong to separate bouts.Criteria to  of the motor pattern were more stringent. In addition to satisfying (1)&#x2013;(3), only P to A wave activity was included, since this was the prevalent type of activity. The determination of wave type had to be both visually confirmed, and supported by appropriate segmental delays in the recordings. The only exceptions to this latter condition were the few single channel recordings that were included based only on visual confirmation of the wave type. Finally, irregular bursting activity that could not be distinguished from wave-related activity was not included. These stricter criteria meant that the number of rhythmically active larvae was often larger that the number whose activity were used for quantification of the motor pattern.Burst start and end times were marked manually in Spike2 by placing cursors at the beginning of the upstroke of the first spike and the beginning of the downstroke of the last spike, respectively. Timestamps were exported as .csv files. Custom code was written in Python version 2.7 to extract burst durations, cycle durations, duty cycles, and quiescence intervals from the preprocessed data. Burst duration was calculated as the time elapsed between the start and end of a burst. Cycle duration was calculated as the time elapsed between start times of successive bursts. Duty cycle was obtained by dividing burst duration by cycle duration. Quiescence interval was calculated as the time elapsed between the end of one burst and the start of the next.Many previous studies analyzing bursting activity in a population have pooled all observations of a particular measure (e.g. all burst durations), irrespective of the animal in which they were recorded, and performed analyses on these pooled data (e.g. in  see ). This violates the assumption of many statistical tests that the observations in a sample are independent of one another (). Multiple bursts gathered from the same animal are not independent measures, and dealing with them as such constitutes pseudoreplication (). Instead, quantiles from each measure were calculated for single animals to approximate the individual probability distribution functions. These approximated distributions were then averaged. The average distribution is representative of an average random variable, which can be compared across groups. Each animal is represented only once in the final analysis, thereby avoiding pseudoreplication. Note that the averaging procedure does not assume a particular distribution of the data. This procedure is described in more detail in .Studies of bursting activity often report the mean and standard deviation to compare data sets. However, such measures are only representative when the data are normally distributed. The data obtained from these experiments were not normally distributed (confirmed by tests for normality; data not shown) and thus were poorly described by a single quantity like the mean. Therefore, for each of the measures, the minimum, maximum, and quartile values are reported to give a more complete description of the distribution. The only exceptions are cycle duration and quiescence interval for which precise maximum values are not reported. This is because all groups included animals whose bursting activity was comprised of bouts separated by 1 min or more. Thus, the maximum cycle duration and quiescence interval were reported as &#x2265; 60 s. The first quartile (Q1) is the value at or below which 25% of the data fall in the distribution. The second quartile (Q2), also known as the median, splits the distribution in half. The third quartile (Q3) is the value delineating 75% of the distribution. To statistically test differences between groups, the Mann-Whitney U test (also known as the rank sum test) was used due to its lack of assumptions about the distribution of the data and its ability to test for shifts in one distribution relative to another (; ; ). The threshold for significance was set at 0.05.
