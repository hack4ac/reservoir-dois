A cross-section of soils (36) were obtained from different areas in NSW, Australia (). Soils were extracted from the field using hand or mechanized corer and intervals removed to plastic tubes for transport and storage. Some of the soils included here were collected as part of other studies hence some variation in depths sampled (indicated on ). Representative amounts were sub-sampled for replicate analyses (&gt;2 per site) to confirm differences observed for these localities which varied considerably by soil type and the amount of OM present. Samples were air and oven (40&#xA0;&#xB0;C) dried prior to removal of recent organic matter such as visible root material by passing a 2&#xA0;mm sieve (). For elemental and thermogravimetric analysis samples were then ground by mortar and pestle and dry sieved (&lt;100&#xA0;) to obtain homogenous material to facilitate the small sample loadings. In addition some soil references () acquired through Proficiency Services Ltd. Hamilton, NZ were included in this study. A legacy dataset of soils (CSIRO National Soil Database) containing LOI, dry combustion and textural data (methods according to ) was also used.Carbon concentrations were determined using a Vario-max Elementar CN analyser (Hanau, Germany) with 900&#xA0;&#xB0;C combustion temperatures (for detailed explanation of the dry combustion method, refer to ).Pure TGA experiments were conducted on a TA Instruments 2950 thermogravimetric analyser which can heat up to 100&#xA0;mg of material at variably programmable rates to over 1000&#xA0;&#xB0;C. Typically 60&#x2013;100&#xA0;mg of soil (equates to several mg OM) were suspended in a platinum pan (tare weight 360&#xA0;mg) such that comparable amounts of C (ranging from &lt;1% to 15%) were analysed. The incremental mass changes (resolution of 0.0001&#xA0;mg) recorded over this program were processed using TA Universal Analysis 2000 software.An oxygen-rich atmosphere was used (60&#xA0; ml/min&#xA0; purging furnace and 40&#xA0; ml/min&#xA0;&#xA0;purging balance) as it provides  in excess for SOM conversion to  which would otherwise degrade in an inert stream and potentially leave a charred residue leading to an incomplete mass loss (possible ghost signals) and underestimation. Evolution of non-combustible components such as interlayer water and  units or  from carbonates are unaffected by the type of atmosphere used during thermal decomposition. Samples were heated to 200&#xA0;&#xB0;C, held for 10 min (surface dehydration) and then ramped at 10&#xA0;&#xB0;C/min to 700&#xA0;&#xB0;C and finally held for another 10 min. Carbonatic soils were heated at the same rate but beyond 700&#xA0;&#xB0;C until completely calcined. Heating rates of 10&#xA0;&#xB0;C/min from 200 to 600&#xA0;&#xB0;C provided the optimal resolution in soils.To look more deeply into the various mass change events, thermal analyses on a small subset of soils were run in combination with mass spectrometry. TGA/MS was carried out with a Setaram setsys 16/18 thermobalance TGA connected via quartz capillary (in 150&#xA0;&#xB0;C jacket) to a Balzers Thermostar quadrupole mass spectrometer set at 70&#xA0;eV (electron energy). This allowed major ion traces to be obtained (electron impact) along the entire heating program and is presented as mass/charge (/). Whole soils (approximately 40&#xA0;mg) were suspended in a Pt pan and heated at the same rates as above in a stream of aerobic purge gas flowing at 40&#xA0; ml/min.
