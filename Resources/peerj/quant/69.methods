A 2.25-m gravity sediment core was obtained from the Atlantis II Deep (21&#xB0;20.76&#x2019; N, 38&#xB0;04.68&#x2019; E) in the Red Sea in 2008 (). Sediment slices of 12&#x2013;15 cm (Sed12), 63&#x2013;66 cm (Sed63), 105&#x2013;108 cm (Sed105), 183&#x2013;186 cm (Sed183), and 222&#x2013;225 cm (Sed222) were used for DNA extraction. Ten grams of sediment from the five layers were used for DNA extraction. The crude DNA was purified with an MO BIO Power Max soil DNA isolation kit (Solana Beach, CA, USA). A REPLI-g MDA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was applied to amplify the microbial genomic DNA from the sediment layers, followed by pyrosequencing on a ROCHE 454 FLX Titanium platform.A flowchart of data analysis is illustrated in . A protein database was downloaded from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, , v51). Pyrosequencing reads were used to BLASTX (BLAST2.2.20) against the protein database, with parameters of &#x201C;-p blastx &#x2212;e 0.0001 &#x2212;m 8 &#x2212;Q 11&#x201D;. Reads for the same KEGG genes were pooled and then sorted into different length ranges in a size increment of 10 bp. The percentage of reads in each of the ranges was calculated. The position of the reads aligned on the full length proteins was determined by the above BLASTX results. If the proteins belonged to the same genus, the protein sizes were generally the same. In each section (10 aa) of the protein, the number of the aligned reads was recorded and the percentage of the reads in all those for the gene was calculated. If the reads were derived from more than one genus according to the result of the best BLAST hits, the proteins in the best hits were first subjected to multiple alignment by ClustalW (www.clustal.org) and then the unaligned parts from both ends were trimmed away. The matching positions of the reads on the proteins were then adjusted to those of the trimmed proteins.Length range of the reads for five sediment samples. The control was the metagenome from the overlying Atlantis II brine water.After the reads were sorted into different KEGG genes, short (&lt;220 bp; see the distribution shown in ) and long reads (&gt;220 bp) were separated and counted as  and . The percentage of the short reads () in a gene was then calculated. An interesting observation was that a majority of these short reads did not have a full-length alignment with a reference protein by the BLAST search. This means that a small part of them could not be matched to known genes under the current searching criteria. Start and stop points in the alignments were then recorded. After hotspots of the alignment start and stop positions were revealed, the flanking parts (&gt;2 bp) were split out and converted to the sequences on the same strand. Gene fragments in these flanking parts were searched again using the BLASTX program with the default settings, which were more relaxed than those used in the previous searching. Both 5&#x2019; and 3&#x2019; flanking sequences were then aligned by MUSCLE v3.6, separately ().The short reads were sorted into groups with respect to their alignment positions relative to the hotspots on the proteins. DNA secondary structures of representative short reads were constructed using the Mfold web server (). Default settings for folding temperature, window size and ionic conditions were employed. To calculate the free energy of all the short reads, UNAFold () was used. The average and standard deviation of the free energy values were then calculated. To compare free energy of the short reads with the other reads in the metagenomes, long reads &gt;300 bp were randomly truncated into short reads. Since the length of a DNA sequence is critical to the measurement of free energy, the average length of the short reads and random reads in a pairwise comparison should be similar. The average lengths of the short reads for different genes ranged between 100 and 160 bp, and thus random reads were further selected to generate four groups of random short reads, with an average length of 100, 120, 140 and 160 bp, respectively. Free energies of the short reads and the random sequences were compared by a Mann-Whitney test in a SPSS package (16.0).The redundancy level of the reads belonging to different genes in  was checked by cdhit-454 (). Similarity of matching parts in the reads was set at 97%, lower than the threshold suggested by the pyrosequencing error rate, and then clusters among the reads were identified. During the check, long reads were retained in each cluster for further removal of redundancy. If at least 50% of a long read was covered by a short read, and if at least 95% of a short read could be aligned on a unique one, the two reads were clustered.Layer-specific overabundance of short reads for some genes. The KEGG genes in the table were abundant in short reads in sizes of &lt;220 bp (the number is shown). The number of all the reads and percentage of the short reads &lt;220 bp are shown for the individual genes. Lengths and dG values are given with + /&#x2212; standard deviation in the parentheses.
