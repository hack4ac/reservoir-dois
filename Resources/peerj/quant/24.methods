Pig embryos were collected from timed pregnancy sows from Ohio breeders. The embryos were immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1 &#xD7; PBS overnight at 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C. They were dehydrated in a methanol series: 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% methanol/ 1 &#xD7; PBS and stored at &#x2212;20&#xA0;&#xB0;C. The pantropical spotted dolphin embryos are part of a museum collection at Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County (LACM). They were transferred for histological, cross-sectional study to Thewissen, and are on long-term loan to NEOMED, but will eventually be returned to LACM. Pig specimens are also in the NEOMED collection. Specimens are described in . They were fixed in 10% formalin buffer and stored in 70% ethanol after collection. Prior to use the embryos were aged according to Carnegie stages (). Due to the limited supply of dolphin embryos, we were only able to stain one specimen at each stage. Mice (C57/B6strain) were mated overnight and the morning of a vaginal plug was regarded as embryonic day E0.5. Embryos were harvested at E10.5, 11.5 and processed following the same protocol as for pigs.Abbreviations &#x2013; CA, embryonic Carnegie stage; E, embryonic day; IHC, Immunohistochemisty; In situ, in situ hybridization; NEOMED, Northeast Ohio Medical University; LACM, Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.To determine protein signaling during tooth development, we assessed the location of BMP4 (Santa Cruz-6896) and FGF8 (Santa Cruz-6958) in the developing dental lamina by immunohistochemistry. Dolphin embryos were dehydrated to 100% ethanol, washed in several xylene baths and embedded in paraffin. The paraffin blocks were sectioned at 7&#xA0;&#xB5;m. After sections were rehydrated, the slides underwent heat-induced antigen retrieval using 0.01 M sodium citrate pH 6.0 to reverse the cross-linking between the proteins in the tissue and formalin. This was carried out for 10&#xA0;min at 90&#x2013;100&#xA0;&#xB0;C with 20&#xA0;min incubation. To prevent enzyme activity naturally present in tissues from reacting with the DAB (Diaminobenzidine), an additional step of 3% hydrogen peroxide was applied to the slides for 5 min.To detect the proteins of interest, we used the avidin&#x2013;biotin complex method as this approach increases the sensitivity of tagging the protein of interest. We followed the protocol using the goat ABC kit (Santa Cruz-2023). Optimization of concentration experiments were performed for each antibody and both antibodies were optimized at a concentration of 1:500 bovine serum. The sections were counterstained with 0.01% Thionin for 15&#xA0;s.Positive staining was determined by the presence of DAB within the tissue. To ensure positive staining was not exogenous, we used two control methods. The first is a negative control that performed the ABC kit protocol without adding the primary antibody to the control slide. The second was a positive control. We compared protein expression across mice, pigs and dolphins of similar ages in tissues outside of the dental regions to determine if the patterns were similar. Positive controls were also compared to literature sources that indicate the proteins of interest should be present in certain tissues during the developmental stages analyzed.We used immunohistochemistry to document protein localization in our dolphin embryos, as RNA is not preserved in our samples, and legal and ethical issues preclude the acquisition of fresh dolphin embryos.To ensure protein localization was similar to RNA expression in the pigs, we performed  hybridization on similar-aged pig embryos based on stage of dental development. Pig-specific probes were cloned from pig cDNA collected on gestation day 21. RNA was extracted using trizol. Polymerase chain reaction was performed to amplify fragments of the pig  and  gene using primers synthesized to amino acid sequences conserved across known mammals and found in pig ESTs. For  the forward primer TTA ACC TCA GCA GCA TCC CAG A and the reverse primer ACA ATC CAG TCA TTC CAG CCC A were used to amplify a 556bp fragment. For  the forward primer TGC TGT TGC ACT TGC TGG TTC T and the reverse primer ATG CAG ATG TAG AGG CCC GTT T were used to amplify a 298bp fragment. PCR amplifications were carried out with a melting temperature of 94&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 1&#xA0;min, 58&#xA0;&#xB0;C annealing temperature for 30&#xA0;s and 72&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 1&#xA0;min extensions for 38 cycles and held at 72&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 10&#xA0;min. PCR products were gel extracted and reamplified using the same PCR protocol. That PCR product was subcloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen). Digoxygenin-UTP labeled probes were made following Roche DIG RNA Labeling kit (11175025910).Whole-mount  hybridization (ISH) was performed according to . To digest tissue and increase probe penetration a proteinase&#xA0;K (10&#xA0;&#xB5;g/ml) treatment was applied for 5&#xA0;min, followed by 1 &#xD7; PBS with tween-20 washes. Probe was added at a concentration of 0.5&#xA0;&#xB5;l/ml of prehybridization solution for 48&#xA0;h at 65&#xA0;&#xB0;C. Localization of the probe is detected with an alkaline phosphate-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (Antidig-AP Fab Roche 11093274910) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (BCIP) plus 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT).We documented morphological changes in the dentition of fossil and modern Cetacea using our own collections and supplemented with data from the literature (). We focused on fossils from the Eocene, when cetaceans strongly reduced precise occlusion () and the Oligocene, when polydonty and homodonty originated in both odontocetes () and mysticetes (). In mysticetes, these changes preceded the loss of teeth altogether (). As part of this morphological analysis, we quantified pointedness as cusp height divided by tooth length () for lower molars of both fossil and modern species (). Cusp height was measured as the perpendicular distance from the cusp tip to a line connecting the rostral and caudal enamel&#x2013;dentin junctions. Molar length is measured as the distance between the rostral and caudal enamel&#x2013;dentin junctions. Larger values represent increased pointedness and document the morphological shift toward a simple, single-cusped tooth crown typical of many living odontocetes.This value was quantified as cusp height divided by tooth length as shown on a basilosaurid lower molar.(A)  expression in E11.5 lower mouse developing jaw. Expression is found in the anterior portion of the oral epithelium, between the arrows. (B)  expression in E11.5 lower mouse developing jaw. Expression is found in the posterior portion of the oral epithelium (C)  expression in E21 lower pig developing jaw (NEOMED P206). Expression is found in the anterior portion of the oral epithelium similar to that seen in the mouse (D)  expression in E21 lower pig developing jaw (NEOMED P214). Expression is found in the posterior portion of the oral epithelium similar to that seen in the mouse.We found that the oral epithelium was thickened but no individual teeth were distinguishable at Carnegie stage 17 suggesting that this stage is comparable in dental development to mouse E10.5-11.5. The arrow points to the thickened ridge. The dashed line indicates the separation of the anterior and posterior part of the jaw into equal portions. 3D reconstruction was generated by taking high resolution photographs of unprocessed serial sections (approximately 737 sections), tracing the oral epithelium, followed by aligning and stacking each tracing in Amira (Amira 4.0, Visage Imaging).(A) The anterior (rostral) oral epithelium showing BMPp4 presence.
