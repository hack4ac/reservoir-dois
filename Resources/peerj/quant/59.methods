The  ecotype Columbia (Col) was used as wild-type for developmental experiments as indicated. The  mutant was described earlier (). Plants were grown on 0.5X MS medium (Sigma) under long day condition (16 h light/8 h dark) with a humidity level of 50% and 50 &#xB5;E cool white light. Stress treatments were performed according to .Transient expression assays were performed using  suspension cell culture and tobacco mesophyll protoplasts, respectively, as described (; ; ; ) with slight modifications. Protoplasts were isolated and transformed by PEG (polyethylene glycol) mediated transformation at room temperature (25 &#xB0;C) under dark conditions. Plant expression vectors used are based on the pRT series of vectors (; ). The expression vector for 3HA-HsfA2 and the reporter construct  was described by .To investigate the effect of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation on heat stress response, several broad-spectrum inhibitors were tested. All inhibitors were provided from Calbiochem, dissolved in DMSO as recommended and used at the following final concentrations: Staurosporin (Cat No. 569396) 10 &#xB5;M, Cantharidin (Cat. No. 210155) 10 &#xB5;M, Calyculin (Cat. No. 208851) 0.25 &#xB5;M and Okadaic acid (Cat. No. 459618) 2 &#xB5;M.C-terminal domains (CTD) of several Hsfs were cloned into the pDEST-15 vector (Invitrogen) and expressed in  strain Rosetta (Novagen). Sequences of CTD-Hsfs proteins are described in . GST-tagged Hsf proteins were purified using Glutathione sepharose 4B resin (Amersham) according the manufacturer recommendations. Cell extracts were prepared at different times after heat stress in extraction buffer (25 mM Tris  &#xB1;  HCl pH 7.8, 15 mM EGTA, 75 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 mM MgCl, 1 mM NaF, 0.5 mM NaVO, 15 mM &#x3B2;-glycerophosphate, 15 mM 4-nitrophenylphosphate, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 5 mg/ml leupeptin, 5 mg/ml aprotinin). After centrifugation at 20000xg for 45 min, the cleared supernatant was used. For in-gel protein kinase reactions, cell extracts containing 20 &#xB5;g of total protein per lane were separated by SDS-PAGE. Myelin basic protein (MBP; 0.5 mg/ml) was used as a substrate polymerized in the polyacrylamide gel. After protein renaturation, the kinase reactions were performed in the gel as described (). The gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography.Protoplast extracts containing equal protein amounts (100 &#xB5;g) were subjected to a 2-h preincubation in the presence of 20 &#xB5;l of mixed protein A- and G-Sepharose beads (1:1). The supernatant was then immunoprecipitated with 5 &#xB5;l of anti-HA monoclonal antibody and 20 &#xB5;l of protein G-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 &#xB0;C. The beads were washed three times with wash buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20) and once with kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl, 5 mM EGTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol). Kinase reactions of the immunoprecipitated proteins were performed in 15 &#xB5;l of kinase buffer containing 5 &#xB5;g of MBP, 0.1 mM ATP, and 2 &#xB5;Ci of (&#x3B3;- P) ATP. The protein kinase reactions were performed at room temperature for 30 min, and the reactions were stopped by adding 4x SDS loading buffer. The phosphorylation of MBP was analyzed by autoradiography after separation on 15% SDS-PAGE.Immunoblotting was performed with equal amounts of protein separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore) by electroblotting. Membranes were probed with A-purified M23 (raised against MPK6), or with either anti-HA monoclonal antibody or with anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (A-14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or with anti-GFP antibody (sigma). Membranes were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence as recommended by the manufacturer (Gene Image, Amersham Biosciences).HsfA2 WT and mutated sequences were PCR amplified using the pRTHsfA2 vector () as a template. Primers used for PCRs are listed in . For site directed mutagenesis a first PCR using the following pairs were generated: Hsfa2NS-GW2-CterF/Hsfa2-249A-R (PCR1); Hsfa2NS-GW2-CterF/Hsfa2-T249D-R (PCR2); Hsfa2NS-GW2-R/Hsfa2-T249A-F (PCR3) and Hsfa2NS-GW2-R/Hsfa2-T249D-F (PCR4). PCR1 and PCR3 or PCR2 and PCR4 products were diluted and mixed together and then re-amplified with the Hsfa2NS-GW2-CterF/Hsfa2NS-GW2-R primer pairs to generate HsfA2-T249A and HsfA2-T249D mutants. pRTHsfA2 was also amplified with Hsfa2NS-GW2-CterF/Hsfa2NS-GW2-R to generate the HsfA2-WT version. The three PCR products were then introduced in pDNR207 (Invitrogen) trough a classical Gateway-BP reaction. After sequence verification HsfA2 constructs were introduced in p2GWF7 () by a Gateway-LR reaction (Invitrogen) to give HsfA2-WT-GFP, HsfA2-T249A-GFP, and HsfA2-T249D-GFP plasmids. MPK7 construct was amplified with MPK7NS-GW2-CterF/MPK7NS-GW2-R to generate MPK7-GFP plasmid and was used as a control for immunoblotting (see below). Transient expression assays were performed using  mesophyll protoplasts isolated and transformed as described (). Confocal imaging were performed with a Leica TCS-SP2 confocal microscope and analysed with the Leica confocal software (LCS). Autofluorescence and overlay pictures are described in .Coomassie blue stained phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated HsfA2 protein bands were excised from the SDS-PAGE. Ion trap mass spectrometry was performed as according to the user manual and as described in .
