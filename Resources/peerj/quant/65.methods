Ten adult participants (aged 20&#x2013;64, mean age 33.8 &#xB1; 13.4 years [mean &#xB1; SD]) were recruited from staff and students of the host institution after giving their written informed consent. The study was approved by the institutional Human Research Ethics Committee. Participants were excluded if they had cardiovascular or renal disease, a history of diabetes, stroke and/or neurological conditions, were smokers or on nicotine replacement therapy, or were taking anticholinergic or psychotropic medications. Participants refrained from eating two hours prior to testing and caffeine four hours prior to testing.Bilateral MCA blood flow velocities were measured with a Multigon TOC2M Neurovision TCD system (Multigon Industries Inc., New York, USA) using two 2-MHz transducer probes securely mounted on an adjustable headband. Time-averaged mean blood flow velocity measures (cm/s) were obtained every second (i.e. 1 Hz sampling rate) and stored for off-line analysis.Participants attended an air-conditioned laboratory on four separate occasions at the same time of day, with each visit separated by one week. Assessments in both the lying and sitting positions were conducted on two occasions by Rater 1 (MMcD) and on two occasions by Rater 2 (MAC); both raters had recently performed at least 25 assessments. The order of assessments, either sitting or lying supine, was randomised between raters and sessions. On arrival, the headband that holds the two 2.0 MHz transducers was placed over the head and adjusted for a comfortably firm fit. The 2-MHz transducers were then centred on the temple, adjusted until maximal amplitude signals were obtained bilaterally, at which time they were secured in the headband to ensure stability of the signals for the duration of the experiment. The precise positioning and recording of mean flow velocity in each MCA was performed as previously described () through the trans-temporal windows, above the zygomatic arch. Participants breathed room air through a 2-way non-rebreathing valve and mouth piece with a nose-clip attached and were either seated comfortably in a chair with arm-rests, feet flat on the floor, or lying supine with one pillow for at least 10 min prior to commencing the testing. Participants were advised to perform &#x201C;relaxed breathing, in and out through the mouth&#x201D;.After at least 10 min of breathing room air through the mouthpiece, measurement of CVR was performed during hypercapnia induced by breathing a mixture of 5% CO&#x2013;95% O (Carbogen) from a spirometer. This method was used in preference to breath holding or controlled hypoventilation to avoid concomitant hypoxia which can influence the ventilatory response () and it has been shown to be more reproducible than other methods when performed by the one rater (). Beat-to-beat changes in mean CBV were measured bilaterally during a 30-s baseline period, then breathing the Carbogen mixture for 2 min. Each test was then followed by a 2 min rest period breathing room air again. This procedure was repeated three times both sitting and lying (counterbalanced) separated by a 10 min rest period after changing positions. Participants returned the following week at the same time of day to repeat the study with the same rater, then on two subsequent occasions with the other rater (counterbalanced).The sample size of 10 participants was chosen in accordance with other reliability studies involving TCD (; ). Recordings of bilateral CBV waveforms were averaged over the 30s baseline period in each of the triplicate assessments in each position (for each of the four separate testing sessions). The CBV waveforms obtained during the 2 min periods of hypercapnia were plotted against time and a spline curve was fitted (20% smoothing, LOESS filter) to aid determination of the peak blood flow velocity (Table Curve 2D, Systat Software Inc., CA, USA) (). Calculation of CVR involves comparing beat to beat changes in CBV to a pre-stimulus baseline (; ) and is calculated: 
            This was calculated separately for each of the three measurements in each position on each visit and the average of the three values was used for further analysis.Beat-to-beat cerebral blood flow velocities (CBV) obtained during the 2-min period of hypercapnia were plotted and fitted with a spline curve, enabling the peak of the curve to be identified as peak CBV.All data were analysed using SPSS software (PASW Statistics 18.0) and graphs were created in Sigmaplot 12 (Systat Software, Inc.). Paired t-tests were used to verify differences between left and right sides and between sitting and lying CVR measures. Inter- and intra-rater reliability was established using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). As only two raters were used to score an average rating of CVR which is analysed in a two-way ANOVA model, this is evaluated using a Case 3, average rating or (3,1) ICC model, In accordance with . Results were considered significant at  &lt; 0.05.
