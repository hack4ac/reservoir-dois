Freeze-dried culture stock was obtained from the USDA ARS Culture Collection for  (Santa Maria &amp; Garcia Aser)  NRRL Y-11571 (Type strain) and for  (Ramirez &amp; Gonzalez) Urbina &amp; Blackwell, 2012 comb. nov. NRRL Y-17651 (Type strain). Thomas Jeffries () provided culture stock for  strain CBS 6054. Yeast cultures were grown in 150&#xA0;ml of YPD broth (yeast extract 1%, peptone 2%, and dextrose 2%) with an inoculum (single colony) of cells from streaked YPD agar plates.Total nucleic acids (depleted of ribosomal RNA) were extracted from whole cells (). We purified dsRNA using CF-11 chromatography (). The results (see ) were consistent over the two-year period of more than 10 assays, indicating a stable infection.The tentative totivirus and satellite virus dsRNAs from  were isolated from a CsCl gradient fraction with a density of 1.40&#xA0;g/cc (), which is expected based on the known . Note that even though totiviruses and their satellite viruses are separately encapsidated, there is an overlap in their densities, since particles can encapsidate up to four copies of satellite dsRNA (making a total of about 4.8&#xA0;kbp, essentially the same as the totivirus at 4.6&#xA0;kbp).We extracted total RNA from yeast cells using the Masterpure yeast RNA purification kit (Epicentre) and an RNAse-free DNAse treatment. RNA-seq was used to sequence the putative RNA virus, examine the tRNA expression of the host, test for host expression of known fungal viral sequences, and isolate host protein-coding sequences for bioinformatics analysis. Ribosomal RNA species were removed using the Ribo-zero Magnetic Gold kit (Epicentre). We then prepared an RNA-seq library using the ScriptSeq&#x2122;&#xA0;v2 RNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit (Epicentre). Libraries were quantified using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 Pico Chip and submitted to the University at Buffalo Next Generation sequencing facility for RNA sequencing. The facility carried out RNA-seq using 50-cycle paired-end runs on two flow cells of an Illumina HiSeq 2000.  RNA sequence assembly was carried out in CLC Assembly Cell 4.06 () on an Apple Macintosh Mac Pro Xeon 64-bit workstation. The putative viral contigs were reassembled for mapping purposes using the reference assembly algorithm and the  contigs as references. A total of 409665 reads were mapped to the totivirus with an average coverage of 4404.80 times.The putative viral sequence was confirmed by Sanger sequencing using random and specific primers for cDNA library construction. We used the Takara 5&#x2032;-Full RACE Core Set to expand sequence. Sanger and next generation sequences were compared using Geneious version 5.6.3 created by Biomatters (available from ).Because endogenous RNA viruses of fungi can be fragmented and differ greatly in their nucleotide sequences from known viruses (), PCR probes alone are often an ineffective tool for paleoviral discovery. We therefore carried out 454 Life Sciences () sequencing with GS FLX Titanium series reagents of a DNA library from . This form of sequencing also permitted multigene bioinformatics analysis of the host protein coding genes. Strain identity of the assembly was confirmed by BLAST analysis () of the nuclear ribosomal RNA sequences that are known for . We obtained 614185 reads with about 252&#xA0;Mb of aligned bases. The assembly carried out in Newbler (), yielded 14.7 Mb of aligned bases (488 contigs) with an average peak depth of 12X.To establish that the virus was coded by exogenous RNA and not by the DNA of the host, we compared RT-PCR and PCR products. For RNA templates, DNase-treated extracts were exposed to RT-PCR using the Qiagen one step RT-PCR kit. For DNA templates, nucleic acid extracts were exposed to PCR by excluding reverse transcriptase from the RT-PCR protocol. We amplified a fragment of the single copy xylose reductase gene as a positive control for the PCR of DNA. Primers used were: segoxylF CTGTTCTGAACAGATCTACCGTGC (xylose reductase), segoxylR AAGTATGGGTGGTGTTCAACTTGC (xylose reductase), SvLgap3F CGCAATACGACCAGGAGATTG (RdRp of virus from ), and segoSvLgap3R GTACACCAAGGTTAGTAGACAAG (RdRp of virus from ). cDNA synthesis was performed at 48&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 30&#xA0;min, followed by 15&#xA0;min at 94&#xA0;&#xB0;C for reverse transcriptase deactivation and Taq activation. DNA only reactions were added to the thermal cycler 2&#xA0;min before the end of the previous 94&#xA0;&#xB0;C step to activate the Taq polymerase. PCR amplification was done for 35 cycles of 94&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 30&#xA0;s, 48&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 30&#xA0;s, and 72&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 1&#xA0;min. A final extension at 72&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 10&#xA0;min was performed. New sequences from this study have the following Genbank accession numbers: KC610514, KC616419-KC616429.We obtained amino acid sequences from totivirids using the BLAST blastp algorithm with the the capsid gene and the RdRp sequences of  as queries and E_values &lt;1e&#x2212;05. We searched the non-redundant (nr) peptide sequence database (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, USA) and the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (J.G.I.) genome browser for matches. Fossil or paleoviral copies of Totivirus-like genes were identified by significant BLAST tblastx hits (E_values &lt;1e&#x2212;05) of relevant NCBI databases using the sequences of . Duplicated capsid gene copies adjacent to the complete integrated viral genomes in the assemblies of  and  were assumed to be paralogs (). These duplicated paleoviruses and closely related (i.e.&#xA0;phylogenetic sister viruses) co-infecting viral strains were omitted for the phylogenetic analyses. Sequences were aligned using MAFFT () with default settings. We carried out maximum likelihood analyses with PhyML 3.0 as implemented in Seaview 4.3.5 (; ). Model optimization in Prottest () indicated that the LG&#xA0;+&#xA0;invariable sites parameter ()&#xA0;+&#xA0;gamma parameter for among-site rate variation (G) was the best fit under a Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). For reliability estimates we used SH-like approximate likelihood ratio tests (). Searches were comprised of five random starts under the subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR) algorithm and midpoint rooted. found that concatenation of the two most informative genes from a genomic scale assessment recovered an expected reference fungal phylogeny with strong support. We used the approach of  who concatenated five of the most phylogenetically informative fungal genes () to estimate fungal relations. Accession numbers for the genes used (Minichromosome Maintenance protein 7[MCM7], Kontroller of Growth[KOG1], Elongator complex subunit[ELP3], NAD-specific glutamate dehydrogenase[GDH2], and acetolactate synthase[ILV2]) in the fungal analysis are presented in . Data were collected from GenBank and from our newly sequenced cultures of  and . Sequences were aligned in MAFFT and exposed to maximum likelihood analyses in RAxML 7.3.2 () and in PhyML 3.0. Models were partitioned by gene in RAxML using the best-fit models as indicated by PartitionfinderProtein ().Relative synonymous codon usage () and third position base composition for yeasts and viruses was calculated using the CAIcal server (). For viruses the entire open reading frame of the genome was used in the calculations. For yeasts we used the representative genes from the phylogenetic analysis. Species used for the yeast and viral codon usage analyses are listed in . Bivariate plots of RCSU and base composition were graphed using the R statistical programming language ().FSfinder () was used to locate putative slippery sites and pseudoknots in the totiviral genome. The tRNA for  was folded according to the model for  () using the VARNA secondary structure visualization program ().Structural information for  is from the crystal structure of the ScV L-A capsid protein (). For ScV L-BC (La) and SsV L, structural information was predicted by the I-TASSER webserver using ScV L-A cap as a template (; ).To examine protein expression of paleoviral copies we isolated crude protein from  and  by French press and further isolated proteins migrating between 73&#xA0;kDa and 92&#xA0;kDa from 10% SDS-PAGE. Protein mass spectroscopy was carried out at the Seattle Biomedical Research Institute Proteomics Core Facility.
