In this work we studied the presence of intrinsic disordered proteins (IDP) in the yeast spliceosome. The first step was to search of the UniProt database () for known proteins in the baking yeast&#x2019;s () spliceosome. This query resulted in 140 proteins, from which 109 reviewed entries were selected to make sure that the proteins chosen for analysis were manually annotated and reviewed by UniProtKB curators. The amino acid sequences in FASTA format of all these 109 yeast spliceosomal proteins were retrieved from the UniProt database and used in subsequent analysis.At the next stage, we compared this dataset with a set of yeast spliceosomal proteins found via the comprehensive proteomic analysis of the yeast spliceosomal complex B, activated B, and step 1 complex C (). This experimentally determined set contained 89 proteins directly assigned to different spliceosomal components and complexes.  groups these proteins according to their functional/structural annotations and also lists 20 extra spliceosomal proteins found via the UniProt search.To gain insight into the relationships between sequence and disorder, amino acid compositions of different datasets were compared using an approach recently developed for IDPs (; ). To this end, the fractional difference in composition between a given set of proteins and a set of reference proteins (either a set of yeast spliceosomal proteins or a set of disordered proteins from DisProt database (; )) was calculated for each amino acid residue. The fractional difference was calculated as (C&#x2212;C)/C, where C is the content of a given amino acid in a query protein set, and C is the corresponding content in a set of ordered proteins and plotted for each amino acid. In corresponding plots, the amino acids were arranged from the most order-promoting to the most disorder-promoting ().The intrinsic disorder propensities of the spliceosomal proteins were evaluated by several different disorder predictors, such as PONDR VLXT (), PONDR VSL2 (), PONDR VL3 (), FoldIndex (), IUPred (), TopIDP (), RONN (), and PONDR FIT (). These predictors are briefly described below.PONDR VLXT applies various compositional probabilities and hydrophobic measures of amino acid as the input features of artificial neural networks for the prediction (). PONDR VLXT applies three different neural networks, one for each terminal region and one for the internal region of the sequence. Each neural network is trained by a specific dataset containing only the amino acid residues of that specific region. The final prediction result uses the individual predictors in their respective regions. The transition from one predictor to another is accomplished by computing the average scores of the two predictors for a short region of overlap at the boundary between the two regions. The input features of neural networks include selected compositions and profiles from the primary sequences. PONDR VLXT may underestimate the occurrence of long disordered regions in proteins. Although it is no longer the most accurate predictor, it is very sensitive to the local compositional biases. Hence, this method has significant advantages in finding potential binding sites (; ).PONDR VL3 employs ten neural networks and selects the final prediction by simple major voting. The input features of these predictors are various sequence profiles. This predictor has higher accuracy in predicting longer disordered regions ().PONDR VSL2 is a combination of neural network predictors for both short and long disordered regions. A length limit of 30 residues divides short and long disordered regions. Each individual predictor is trained by the dataset containing sequences of that specific length. And the final prediction is a weighted average determined by a second layer predictor. PONDR VSL2 applies not only the sequence profile, but also the result of sequence alignments from PSI-blast and secondary structure prediction from PHD and PSI-pred. This predictor is one the most accurate predictor in the PONDR family ().IUPred assumes that globular proteins have larger numbers of effective inter-residue interactions (negative free energy) than disordered proteins due to the different types of amino acids involved in possible residue contacts. Based on this idea, a composition-based pair-wise interaction matrix was shown to give values similar to those obtained from a structure-based interaction matrix. Structured and disordered proteins were compared by this approach, with the structured proteins found to have a significantly lower free energy estimate, thus giving a means to predict whether a protein is structured or disordered using amino acid sequence as input ().FoldIndex is a method developed from charge-hydropathy plots () by rearranging the terms in the basic equation and by adding the technique of sliding windows (). The charge-hydropathy plot was designed to determine if a protein is disordered or not. By applying a sliding window of 21 amino acids centered at a specific residue, the position of this segment on charge-hydrophobicity plot can be calculated, and the distance of this position away from the boundary line is taken as an indication whether the central residue is disordered or not ().TopIDP is a numerical scale giving the order&#x2013;disorder propensity for each amino acid. This scale was determined by maximizing the differences in conditional probabilities for structured versus disordered regions of proteins for the central residues in windows of 21 residues ().PONDR FIT () is a meta-predictor that combines six individual predictors, which are PONDR VLXT (), PONDR VSL2 (), PONDR VL3 (), FoldIndex (), IUPred (), TopIDP (). This meta-predictor is moderately more accurate than each of the component predictors.RONN is the regional order neural network software that applies the &#x201C;biobasis function neural network&#x201D; pattern recognition algorithm for the detection of natively disordered regions in proteins. It predicts disordered structures based on the sequence alignments ().. Cumulative distribution function curves or CDF curves () were generated for each dataset using PONDR FIT scores for each of the spliceosomal proteins. CDF analysis discriminates between order and disorder by means of a boundary value (). This value can be interpreted as a measure of proportion of residues with low and high disorder predictions. Additionally, charge-hydropathy distributions (CH-plots) were also analyzed for these proteins using methods as described in .&#x3B1;- The predictor of helix forming lecular ecognition eatures, &#x3B1;-MoRF, is based on observations that predictions of order in otherwise highly disordered proteins corresponds to protein regions that mediate interaction with other proteins or nucleic acids. This predictor focuses on short binding regions within long regions of disorder that are likely to form helical structure upon binding (). It uses a stacked architecture, where PONDR VLXT is used to identify short predictions of order within long predictions of disorder and then a second level predictor determines whether the order prediction is likely to be a binding site based on attributes of both the predicted ordered region and the predicted surrounding disordered region. An &#x3B1;-MoRF prediction indicates the presence of a relatively short (20 residues), loosely structured helical region within a largely disordered sequence (; ). Such regions gain functionality upon a disorder-to-order transition induced by binding to partners (; ). In addition to MoRF identifiers, potential binding sites in disordered regions can be identified by the ANCHOR algorithm (; ). This approach relies on the pairwise energy estimation approach developed for the general disorder prediction method IUPred (; ), being based on the hypothesis that long regions of disorder contain localized potential binding sites that cannot form enough favorable intrachain interactions to fold on their own, but are likely to gain stabilizing energy by interacting with a globular protein partner (; ). Here we are using the term ANCHOR-indicated binding site (AIBS) to identify a region of a protein suggested by the ANCHOR algorithm to have significant potential to be a binding site for an appropriate but typically unidentified partner protein.We selected the 24 most disordered spliceosomal proteins according to an average between the disorder scores calculated by different predictors for more focused analysis of their structures, disorder propensities, and functions. In addition to the level of predicted intrinsic disorder, these proteins were chosen to represent all the major components and complexes comprising the yeast spliceosome. These proteins were researched for their function, structures, location within the spliceosome, etc. This information was obtained from the UniProtKB, and validated through the literature search.
