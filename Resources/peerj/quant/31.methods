Rituximab (Rituxan&#x2122;; Genentech, Inc.) and ofatumumab (Arzerra&#x2122;; GlaxoSmithKline, Inc.) were purchased through the North Carolina Cancer Hospital pharmacy. Pooled human serum was obtained from volunteers and used as a source of complement.The CEPH cell lines, EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines from normal individuals, were obtained from the Coriell Institute (Camden, NJ) and lymphoma cell lines were obtained from the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) Tissue Culture Facility (). Cell lines were maintained in RPMI media containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100&#xA0;&#xB5;g/ml streptomycin sulfate except for the Daudi cell lines which were maintained in media containing 20% FBS. For the establishment of resistant cell lines, parental cells were exposed to 10&#xA0;&#xB5;g/ml rituximab in the presence of 25% human serum for 24&#xA0;h. Treated cells were then returned to normal media and allowed to recover for 4&#x2013;5 days. This process was repeated for approximately 10 passages.Publicly available gene expression data for 57 of the lymphoblastoid CEPH cell lines used in this study were available in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Dataset GSE12626 (time = 0 samples were used). CEL files were downloaded from the GEO site and normalized using Robust Multichip Average (RMA) in the Bioconductor package using R statistical software, version 2.12.1. Expression data from the two probesets (210356_x_at, 210356_x_at) interrogating  (CD20) were averaged. Average expression was plotted against viability of each cell line in rituximab.&#xA0;Cells were seeded at 5 &#xD7; 10 cells in a 96-well plate in a total volume of 100&#xA0;&#xB5;l media containing 25% pooled human serum with or without 10&#xA0;mg/ml rituximab overnight. Proliferation was then measured using Alamar Blue (AbD Serotec Ltd.) according to manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Dye was added to samples and incubated for approximately eight hours. Fluorescence was then measured with excitation at 535&#xA0;nm and emission at 595&#xA0;nm. Proliferation was expressed relative to samples without antibody (rituximab or ofatumumab).Total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and RNA (1&#xA0;&#xB5;g) reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Roche) according to manufacturer instructions. Conventional PCR was performed using Taq PCR Master Mix (Qiagen Inc.) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using SsoFast&#x2122;&#xA0;EvaGreen (Bio-Rad) master mix. Reactions used 400 nM each of forward and reverse primers prepared by the Nucleic Acids Core Facility (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). The annealing temperature was 59&#xA0;&#xB0;C. The primers used were: 1-CD20F (5&#x2019;-GAGCCAATGAAAGGCCCTATT-3&#x2019;) and CD20R (5&#x2019;-TGCTGCCAGGAGTGATCCGGAA-3&#x2019;) for analysis of CD20 mRNA; 1-CD20F and 350-CD20R (5&#x2019;-AGCTATACAAGTTCCAGTG-3&#x2019;) for specific analysis of the 350&#xA0;bp splice variant; 1-CD20F and 650-CD20R1 (5&#x2019;-CACTGACAAAATGCCCAAACACTTC-3&#x2019;) or 650-CD20R2 (5&#x2019;-GCTATTACAAGTTCCAAACACTTCC-3&#x2019;) for specific analysis of the 650&#xA0;bp splice variants. To obtain sequence data, PCR products were extracted from gel slices using a QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) and sequenced using the PCR primers (Genomic Analysis Core Facility, University of North Carolina).2 &#xD7; 10 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Dulbecco&#x2019;s PBS, 0.1% Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate, 0.5% Sodium Deoxycholate, and 1% Igepal NP-40 supplemented with 1 mM PMSF, 1x cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), and 1x Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 2 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). An aliquot was used for protein determination using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Technology, Inc., St. Louis, MO). The remaining sample was mixed with 0.5 vol. of 3x SDS sample buffer (1x equals 31.25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% sucrose, and 0.005% bromophenol blue) and heated for 5&#xA0;min at 95&#xA0;&#xB0;C. Equivalent protein amounts were run on SDS-PAGE in Tris/glycine/SDS buffer using 10% acrylamide gels. Resolved proteins were then transferred to PVDF membranes. Blots were blocked using a 5% solution of nonfat dry milk in 20mM Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 140&#xA0;mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 and exposed to antibodies in the same buffer. A rabbit anti-CD20 antibody (Thermo Scientific, Cat. # RB-9013) was used. Anti-LMP-1 was a kind gift from Dr. Blossom Damania (Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina). Anti-&#x3B2;-actin (Sigma) was used as a load control. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used with ECL detection reagent (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.) to visualize immunoreactive bands. Protein levels were quantified with an Agfa Duoscan T2500 scanner (Agfa Corp.) followed by densitometry using NIH Image 1.61.1.0 &#xD7; 10 cells were centrifuged, then resuspended in 100&#xA0;&#xB5;l cold Dulbecco&#x2019;s PBS buffer containing 0.1% sodium azide, 1.0% FBS, and 1% pooled human serum and kept on ice for 30&#xA0;min. For analysis of CD20 expression, 10&#xA0;&#xB5;l of FITC-&#x3B1;CD20 (BD Biosciences) was added and samples incubated for an additional 45&#xA0;min before adding an equal volume of buffer. Samples were centrifuged and pellets resuspended in 0.5&#xA0;ml of the same buffer containing 5&#xA0;nM TOPRO-3 (Invitrogen), which was used to distinguish viable cells. For analysis of CD55 and CD59, 10&#xA0;&#xB5;l of premixed R-PE-&#x3B1;CD55/FITC-&#x3B1;CD59 (Invitrogen) antibodies were used per sample. Phenotyping was performed on a Beckman-Coulter (Dako) CyAn flow cytometer. Data analysis was performed with FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.).Unpaired, two-tailed  tests were done using Prism software (version 2.0; GraphPad Software). Correlation coefficients were calculated with Stata (version 10.1) or Microsoft Excel.
