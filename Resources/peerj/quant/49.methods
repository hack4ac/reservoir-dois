This study examines the differential expression of genes between normal skin and/or benign nevi, and metastatic melanoma using a meta-analysis approach. The experimental protocol of this study is shown in  and commenced with the identification of 16 microarray studies on metastatic melanoma published 2000 to 2011. Microarray data included in these studies are shown in . In the current study, we focused our attention on the differential gene expression between normal skin and/or benign nevi and metastatic melanoma. On this basis four microarray datasets were extracted (GEO access number: GSE7553, GSE4587, GSE4579, and GSE12391). An additional GSE22301 dataset was extracted from , but while this study did not provide a gene signature of metastatic melanoma (and so was not included in the meta-analysis of 16 studies) it did include 14 samples of metastatic melanoma data and so was included in our integrative analysis. Thus, a total of five microarray datasets of normal and/or benign nevi and metastatic melanoma were used in this study ().A relatively simple method of integrative meta-analysis was proposed by  in  that combines independent microarray studies based on the -value of each individual gene:  where ,&#xA0;&#xA0;=&#xA0;1&#x2013;, is the -value of a gene in the -th independent study. However, this method has at least two significant limitations: (1) many microarray studies are based on a small number of samples, for which the -value can therefore be problematic and (2) the large variation in -values across different studies leads to the data with smallest -value determining the outcome of .We propose a new approach based on measuring the genome-wide relative significance (GWRS) and genome-wide global significance (GWGS) of expressed genes. We measure the GWRS of a gene using its ranking position () on a genome-wide scale ( value) based on a differential expression measure, which can be the fold change, -test -value, SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarray data) -value etc. Most existing meta analysis methods focus on the top- genes (e.g. ), while our method counts the ranking of genome-wide genes in total. Compared to the model of Rhodes and co-workers the proposed approach possess two important enhancements: (1) it can apply multiple different methods for measuring the degree of differential expression of a gene (e.g.&#xA0;fold change, -test, Anova or SAM -values) and (2) it uses a ranking  value instead of the test statistic (i.e.,&#xA0;fold change, or -value) to avoid the influence of high variation test statistics.Pre-processing of microarray data is performed by extracting the expression value for each individual gene from the associated probe-sets. When a probe-set is mapped to multiple genes, e.g.&#xA0;&#x2018;209994_s_at&#x2019; associated to two genes &#x2018;ABCB1 / ABCB4&#x2019; in GSE4570, both genes are given the expression of the &#x2018;209994_s_at&#x2019; probe-set.For a gene appearing in multiple probe-sets, the most significant differential expressed probe-sets are assigned to this gene. We tested the results of using mean-, median-, and maxim-based methods to deal with the situations were multiple probe-sets are associated to a gene. We observed that the maxim-based method was able to retrieve the most significant probe-set of a gene, and would reflect our aim of extracting the most competitive genes across multiple studies. By contrast, use of a mean- or median-based probe-set value of a gene would drag the expression level down, and may introduce bias in follow-up analysis. As a result, a list of unique genes (G) from the datasets was retrieved. The number of datasets was denoted by , while the number of unique genes across  datasets was denoted by , i.e.&#xA0;&#xA0;=&#xA0;|G|. The value &#x2018;NA&#x2019; was applied in cases where a gene is absent from an individual study. We removed a gene from G where NA is bigger than &#x3B4; (&#x3B4;&#xA0;=&#xA0;2 in this study), i.e.&#xA0;a gene was removed if it is absent for more than two of five datasets. This resulted in &#xA0;=&#xA0;24,097 and &#xA0;=&#xA0;5.For each gene in the list of unique genes (G), we measured the degree of differential expression that can be measured by fold-change, -test (-value), SAM or other statistical test. However, fold-change is used in the current study, as our computational evaluation indicated that this produces more reliable results, probably due to the limited number of samples in some of the datasets. For each gene in G, we assigned a rank number (in descending order starting from 1 to ) according to their corresponding degree of differential expression i.e.&#xA0;a gene with a high degree of differential expression was ranked more highly and so with a smaller ranking number. An &#x2217; matrix () was thus created in which  is the ranking number of the -th gene in the -th dataset. We measure the GWRS of the -th gene in the -th dataset by:  where ,&#xA0;&#xA0;=&#xA0;1&#x2013;,&#xA0;&#xA0;=&#xA0;1&#x2013;, is the rank number of the -th gene in the -th study. The range of GWRS value () is between 0 and &#x2212;2log(1/). For a gene with &#x2018;NA&#x2019; value the  is set to be &#x2018;NA&#x2019;.We estimated the GWGS () of a gene based on its corresponding GWRS across  datasets, by  where &#x3C9; represents the relative weight of the -th dataset, and . The value of weight (&#x3C9;) can be assigned based on the data quality of the -th datasets (e.g.&#xA0;the level of data noise. The value of &#x3C9; can also be used to reflect the differential importance of biopsy versus cell line samples that biological scientists may wish to take into account. In this study, we treated all the dataset equally, thus the weight of each datasets was set equally to be 1/ for &#xA0;=&#xA0;1&#x2013;. We also selected only the top 200 genes from the full gene list for further analysis (i.e.&#xA0;selected genes with the greatest  value) by empirical evaluation of the classification performance (accuracy ratio). This was determined using the &#x2018;wrapper-feature selection&#x2019; after multiple rounds of gene addition (ranging from 20 genes up to 500 genes) in order to distinguish melanoma from normal skin/benign nevus. We observed that using more than 200 genes yielded no improvement in classification ratio values, and so we consider 200 genes as an optimal gene set with the smallest number of genes that still can achieve a similar level of classification performance.We performed a pathway analysis to assess functional relevance of the new 200 gene signature based on the DAVID database (). DAVID provides a useful tool to analyze large gene lists, including via gene ontology and pathway analysis. We applied our top 200 genes to this database in order to detect potentially over-represented KEGG pathways. Before inputting into the DAVID database, we extracted the corresponding probe-sets of the 200 genes for the corresponding microarray platforms of each dataset. In comparison with the gene signature in the original 16 studies, we also extracted their associated probe-sets. We retrieved 31 pathways from the KEGG database where 12 genes (i.e.,&#xA0; and ) in this 200-gene signature were found to closely interact with the 4 melanoma driver genes (see Results section).Primary epidermal melanocyte (EM) (female 44y), moderately pigmented human melanoma cells (FM55), and highly pigmented human melanoma cells (FM94) (melanoma cells were a gift of Dr Janis Ancans, University of Latvia) were cultured as previously described (). The cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol (Sigma, Poole, Dorset, UK) for 10 min before air drying and rehydration in PBS. The cells were blocked with 10% donkey serum (DS) for 1&#xA0;h, washed with PBS before incubation with respective primary antibodies to four test antigens from this 12-gene signature. These included: COL11A1 (Abcam, ab64883), CXCL13 (R &amp; D Systems, AF801), PTPRF (NeuroMab, 75-193), SHC4 (Proteintech, 12641-1-AP), which were incubated overnight at 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C followed by secondary antibody (1:300) for 1&#xA0;h (donkey anti-goat (Invitrogen, A11055), donkey anti-mouse (Invitrogen, A21202), donkey anti-rabbit (Invitrogen, A21206), Alexa green). The slides were cover-slipped by VECTASHIELD mounting medium with DAPI and photographed using a Nikon Eclipse 80i fluorescence microscope and imaged with a Nikon Digital Sight DS-U1 camera. A full assessment of all 12 proteins in our melanoma signature is beyond the scope of the current study, but will be assessed in detail in a follow-up studies.Paraffin-embedded primary melanoma  (nose) and metastatic melanoma (lower leg) were deparaffinized and boiled in sodium citrate buffer (10 mM, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval. Acetone-fixed cryosections of normal human facial skin (Female 52 yrs) were used as control samples. All tissues were blocked with 10% donkey serum (DS) for 1&#xA0;h, washed with PBS before 2&#xA0;h incubation with NKi/beteb antibody raised against the melanocyte lineage-specific marker gp100 as a positive pigment cell control (Monosan; Mon7006-1) (1:15) followed by each of the 4 test antibodies at room temperature.The microarray data used in this study were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with the following access numbers: GSE4570, GSE4587, GSE7553, GSE12391, and GSE22301. The 16 signatures of melanoma reported in the literature between 2000 and 2011 were extracted from the associated publication and is presented in .
