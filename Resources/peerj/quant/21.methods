Common periwinkles () were purchased from the Kowloon Market, Ottawa. The snails were placed in a 30 L tub of aerated, full strength seawater (1000&#xA0;mOsmol/L made using Instant Ocean Sea Salt; salinity confirmed with a buoyancy meter) at 9&#xA0;&#xB0;C in an incubator with constant darkness. No food was provided but the water was changed periodically and any dead snails were removed. Experiments to gather aerobic control (sampled directly from the seawater) and 24 h anoxia-exposed snails were commenced after 7 days of acclimation.For anoxia exposure, 25 snails were placed in each of several sealed jars that were fitted with two gas ports. The containers were held on ice and contained a small amount of deoxygenated seawater (1&#xA0;cm deep) which had been bubbled previously with  gas for 30&#xA0;min before addition to the jars. The lids were tightened and sealed with parafilm and then a gas line was connected to one of the ports whereas the other port was opened to vent the gas.  gas was continuously bubbled into the water in the jars for a further 20&#xA0;min. Then the  line was removed, the ports were closed and the containers were returned to the 9&#xA0;&#xB0;C incubator for a 24 h anoxia exposure.For sampling of anoxic snails, a container of snails was removed from the incubator, placed on ice and nitrogen gassing was reinstated. Snails were sampled from the jar, quickly dissected, and hepatopancreas samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were stored at &#x2212;80&#xA0;&#xB0;C until use.Frozen samples of hepatopancreas were homogenized 1:5 w:v in ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 50&#xA0;mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% v:v glycerol, 10&#xA0;mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 25&#xA0;mM NaF, 2.5&#xA0;mM EDTA and 2.5&#xA0;mM EGTA. The latter three buffer components provide inhibition of protein phosphatases and protein kinases to ensure that the phosphorylaion state of the enzyme does not change prior to assay. A few crystals of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), a protease inhibitor, were also added at the time of homogenization. Homogenates were centrifuged at 13,500&#xA0;g for 30 min at 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C and the supernatant was decanted and held on ice.To properly assess G6PDH properties, low molecular weight metabolites and ions were removed from the enzyme preparation by Sephadex G-50 gel filtration. A 5&#xA0;cm column of Sephadex G-50 in a syringe barrel was equilibrated in homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 500&#xA0;g in a bench-top centrifuge for 2 min to remove excess buffer which was discarded. Then a 500&#xA0;&#xB5;L aliquot of supernatant was layered on top, the column was centrifuged again and the protein-containing eluant was removed and stored on ice.G6PDH activity was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the production of NADPH (extinction coefficient of 6220&#xA0;M&#xA0;cm) at 340 nm using a Thermo Labsystems Multiskan Spectrum Microplate Spectrophotometer. Optimal assay conditions were 4&#xA0;mM G6P, 1.0&#xA0;mM , 50&#xA0;mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Reactions were initiated by adding 5&#xA0;&#xB5;l of enzyme extract (10&#xA0;&#xB5;lfor incubation studies or 50&#xA0;&#xB5;l for assaying column fractions) to a 200&#xA0;&#xB5;L total reaction volume. Microplate Analysis (MPA) and Kinetics 3.51 computer programs were used to analyze data and obtain kinetic parameters (). One unit of G6PDH activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that produces 1&#xA0;&#xB5;mol 6-phosphogluconolactone per min at 22&#xA0;&#xB0;C and activities were expressed as mU/mg soluble protein. Soluble protein content was quantified using the Coomassie blue dye binding method and the Bio-Rad prepared reagent with a standard curve for bovine serum albumin.A pH profile of G6PDH activity was conducted by measuring activity under optimal conditions at 22&#xA0;&#xB0;C for pH values ranging from 6.0 to 10.5. A 50&#xA0;mM Bis-Tris Propane buffer was used for pH 6.0&#x2013;9.0 and CAPS buffer was used for pH 9.5&#x2013;10.5. Standard kinetic parameters were determined at pH 6.0 and pH 8.0 for hepatopancreas preparations from both aerobic control and 24 h anoxic conditions. For pH 6.0 assays, MES buffer was used for both homogenization and assay (with the same components as in the standard Tris homogenization and assay buffers).Hepatopancreas homogenates were prepared as previously described and G6PDH susceptibility to urea denaturation was assessed by incubating samples of crude hepatopancreas extract from control and anoxic snails with different concentrations of urea (0&#x2013;1 M) in homogenization buffer, pH 8.0 for 24 h at 22&#xA0;&#xB0;C. After incubation, aliquots of sample were used to measure remaining G6PDH activity under standard assay conditions.Sephadex G-50 filtered soluble protein extracts of hepatopancreas from aerobic and anoxic snails were used to assess the effects of NaCl, KCl, and  on G6PDH activity at concentrations up to 2 M. Comparable effects of selected metabolites were assessed in both pH 6 and pH 8 assays; metabolites tested included L-alanine, L-aspartic acid, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), AMP and succinate (0&#x2013;10&#xA0;mM concentration range for each metabolite). Assays were performed at suboptimal susbtrate concentrations (0.15&#xA0;mM , 0.1 mM G6P, at pH 8).Maximum G6PDH velocity was measured at &#x223C;5&#xA0;&#xB0;C intervals between 5&#xA0;&#xB0;C and 30&#xA0;&#xB0;C. Arrhenius plots were constructed and the energy of activation () was calculated. To alter reaction temperature, the microplate reader was placed in a Precision Low Temperature Incubator 815 and temperature was adjusted to the desired values. Filled microplates were placed into the spectrophotometer and allowed to equilibrate to the desired temperature for several minutes before the assay was commenced by addition of enzyme. A telethermometer was used to measure microplate well temperature before and after assay.DEAE-Sephadex columns (5&#xA0;cm &#xD7; 1&#xA0;cm) were equilibrated in column buffer (25&#xA0;mM Tris-HCl, 5% v:v glycerol, 5&#xA0;mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 12.5&#xA0;mM NaF, 1.25&#xA0;mM EDTA, 1.25&#xA0;mM EGTA, pH 7.0). A 300&#xA0;&#xB5;l aliquot of supernatant was added to each column, followed by washing with 10 mL of the same buffer to remove unbound proteins. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0&#x2013;0.5 M KCl in 20 mL of column buffer. Hepatopancreas extracts from aerobic control and 24 h anoxia-exposed snails were run separately and fractions were collected with a Gilson FC203B fraction collector. G6PDH activity was assayed under optimal assay conditions using 50&#xA0;&#xB5;l from each fraction.G6PDH was partially purified using affinity chromatography. A 1 mL aliquot of crude hepatopancreas extract was added to a blue-agarose column (3&#xA0;cm &#xD7; 1&#xA0;cm,h &#xD7; d) equilibrated in column buffer. G6PDH was then eluted with a 0&#x2013;1 M KCl gradient. The fraction with the highest activity was selected and mixed 1:1 (v:v) with SDS loading buffer (100 mM Tris buffer, pH 6.8, 4% w:v SDS, 20% v:v glycerol, 0.2% w:v bromophenol blue and 10% v:v 2-mercaptoethanol) , boiled for 5 min, cooled on ice and frozen at &#x2212;20&#xA0;&#xB0;C until use.SDS resolving gels (8% v/v acrylamide, 400&#xA0;mM Tris, pH 8.8, 0.1% w/v SDS, 0.2% w/v ammonium persulfate [APS], 0.04% v/v TEMED) were prepared with a 5% stacking gel (5% acrylamide, 190&#xA0;mM Tris, pH 6.8, 0.1% w/v SDS, 0.15% w/v APS, 0.1% v/v TEMED). Partially purified G6PDH samples were loaded onto these gels and separated electrophoretically in SDS-PAGE running buffer (25&#xA0;mM Tris-base, 190&#xA0;mM glycine, and 0.1% w/v SDS) at 180 V for 45 min. A 3&#xA0;&#xB5;L aliquot of Spectra&#x2122;&#xA0;Multicolor Broad Range Protein Ladder was added to one lane of every gel. Following electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidienedifluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore) by wet transfer. Electroblotting was perfomed at room temperature for 1.5 h at 160 mA in transfer buffer (25&#xA0;mM Tris, pH 8.5, 192&#xA0;mM glycine, and 20% v/v methanol).Following protein transfer, PVDF membranes were incubated overnight at 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C with a phospho-serine primary antibody (Calbiochem) diluted at 1:1000 in Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20 (TBST; 20&#xA0;mM Tris-base, 140&#xA0;mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) with a small amount of sodium azide added. Subsequently, membranes were washed with TBST three times for 5&#xA0;min each, followed by incubation with anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Bioshop Canada) at a dilution of 1:4000 in TBST. Membranes were incubated at room temperature for 30&#xA0;min and then washed three times for 5 min each with . Bands were then detected using enzymatic chemiluminescence (ECL), initiated by the addition of 600&#xA0;&#xB5;L of hydrogen peroxide and 600&#xA0;&#xB5;L of luminol reagent to the membrane&#x2019;s surface for several seconds followed by visualization using a ChemiGenius Bioimaging System (Syngene, MD, USA). Membranes were then stained with Coomassie blue (0.25% w/v Coomassie Brilliant Blue R in 50% methanol, 7.5% acetic acid) and destained with destaining solution (60% v/v methanol, 20% v/v acetic acid in ) until bands were clearly seen. Band densities were analyzed using Bioimaging software, and were standardized against the corresponding Coomassie blue stained bands. The G6PDH band on the phospho-serine Western blot was determined through a seperate Western blot which used an anti-G6PDH antibody (StressGen).The effects of endogenous protein kinases and phosphatases on G6PDH were analyzed by incubating hepatopancreas extracts from control and anoxic snails under conditions that stimulated the activities of specific endogenous protein kinases or protein phosphatases. Tissue extracts were prepared in standard homogenization buffer (denoted STOP). After centrifugation, 150&#xA0;&#xB5;l aliquots of soluble protein extract were incubated in  of the specific incubation solutions for 4 h at 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C. After incubation, samples were subjected to Sephadex G-50 gel filtration to remove metabolites that could interfere with the enzyme assay.  G6P values were determined under standard conditions at pH 8.0 useing 10&#xA0;&#xB5;l of incubation mixture for assay. The specific incubation solutions used were as follows:STOP: standard homogenization bufferBase Buffer: 50&#xA0;mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 10&#xA0;mM 2-mercaptoethanol

            To confirm that incubations that stimulated protein kinases actually transfered phosphate groups onto G6PDH, these incubations were repeated in the presence of P-ATP. Then the radiolabelled phospho-G6PDH was immunoprecipitated using an anti-G6PDH antibody.For optimal detection of phosphorylation, studies began with the dephosphorylated enzyme. Tissue extracts were prepared and low molecular weight solutes were removed via Sephadex G-50 filtration. Extracts were then incubated for 4 h under conditions that promoted Total Phosphatase action, as described above. Aliquots of dephosphorylated enzyme were then incubated under either STOP or Total Kinase incubation conditions (as above) with the inclusion of  &#x3B3;-P-ATP in a 300&#xA0;&#xB5;l incubation volume, in addition to the regular amount of nonradioactive ATP. Following a 24 h incubation at 5&#xA0;&#xB0;C, 60&#xA0;&#xB5;l of insoluble Protein A (IPA; Sigma) suspension was added and further incubated overnight at 5&#xA0;&#xB0;C. Following this, samples were then centrifuged at 800&#xA0;g in a Biofuge for 10 min to remove proteins that bound nonspecifically to Protein A and the supernatants were removed. Supernatant samples were then incubated with 1&#xA0;&#xB5;g G6PDH primary antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at 5&#xA0;&#xB0;C and then 60&#xA0;&#xB5;l of IPA was added and incubated overnight, again at 5&#xA0;&#xB0;C. Along with the G6PDH antibody, 50% polyethylene glycol-8000 was also added to the incubation tube to give a final PEG concentration of 5%. Following incubation, samples were centrifuged at 800&#xA0;g for 10 min. Supernatants were decanted and the pellets were resuspended in 100&#xA0;&#xB5;l of 50&#xA0;mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5. Pellet washing was repeated 7 times and after the final wash, 5&#xA0;&#xB5;l of each sample was spotted on P81 paper and exposed to a phosphorscreen for 1 h. Quantification of radioactivity was done using a Personal Molecular Imager-FX (BioRad).
