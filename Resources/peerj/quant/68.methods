Animal studies were approved by the Ohio State University (OSU) and University of California, San Francisco Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. The OSU IACUC determined that the research performed at OSU was exempt from IACUC review as pre-existing or commercially available animal specimens were used for this study. Fresh frozen skin samples from three FVB/NJ and three SPRET/EiJ female mice aged 4&#x2013;5 weeks were obtained through the Jackson Laboratory surgical service. RNA was isolated from the skin using standard Trizol extractions (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). We isolated RNA a second time from two of the skin samples to generate a replicate control for the microarrays. Samples were DNAase treated. RNA was quantitated using Nanodrop (ThermoScientific, Wilmington, DE). RNA was isolated from eleven cSCCs from chemically treated C57Bl6/FVB F1 mice using standard Trizol methods. RNA samples were DNAase treated.Five &#xB5;g of total RNA from each sample was sent to the OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center MicroArray Shared Resource for miRNA expression analysis using the miRNA microarray chip OSUCCC version 4.0 (; ). For each strain of mice, a fourth RNA sample of a second independent RNA isolation was also evaluated. The arrays contain over 300 human and mouse miRNAs spotted in triplicate with probes for both precursor and mature miRNAs. Experiments were performed and analyzed as previously described (; ). In brief, a linear model was employed to detect differentially expressed miRNAs. In order to improve the estimates of variability and statistical tests for differential expression, a variance smoothing method with fully moderated -statistic was employed for this study (). The significance level was adjusted by controlling the mean number of false positives ().. qPCR was performed using Applied Biosystems TaqMan probes to validate expression of the six candidate miRNAs (Foster City, CA). Probes were specific to either mature (, , ) or precursor (, ) miRNAs concordant with the array results. Reverse transcription for mature miRNAs was performed using Applied Biosystem&#x2019;s High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription reagents according to manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol in 7.5 &#xB5;l reactions (Carlsbad, CA). Three independent skin RNA samples were used for each strain from samples not used on the original arrays. qPCR of  levels from eleven primary mouse cSCCs was conducted as for normal skin. For miRNA quantification, real-time PCR was performed using Applied Biosystem TaqMan Assays per manufacturer&#x2019;s recommended conditions. All samples were done in triplicate. qPCR runs included no template and no-reverse transcriptase controls. Expression was normalized to expression levels for  RNA for mature miRNAs or to 19 for pri-miRNAs. qPCR was conducted using Applied Biosystems 7900HT instrument. Cycle threshold (CT) values were averaged across triplicates and delta CT values were calculated between each test miRNA and control. The fold expression of SPRET/EiJ miRNA relative to FVB/NJ was calculated. Standard deviations of fold differences of the percentage of reference gene expression were made by comparisons between independent RNA samples of each of the test samples. Student&#x2019;s -test was used to calculate -values for the qPCR. A nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was performed to test for differences between  expression in tumors versus SPRET/EiJ and FVB normal skin.. To measure expression of predicted targets, mRNA expression was measured at 48 and 72 h post  or scrambled precursor miR negative control transfection in A5 cells and at 48, 72 and 96 h post-transfection in B9 cells using SYBR green quantitative real-time PCR. Reverse transcription of mRNA was performed using a Bio-Rad iScript cDNA synthesis kit according to manufacturer&#x2019;s recommended conditions. Primers were designed using Integrated DNA Technologies. Target gene expression was measured using Bio-Rad SYBR Green Supermix in 10 &#xB5;l reactions according to manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol. qPCR of each sample was performed in triplicate and was used to measure  and  target gene expression. The following primer sets were used. : Forward: 5&#x2019; TGTATGAGTGGAGCAGCACTGTGT 3&#x2019;, Reverse: 5&#x2019; AGGTAGGGTCTCCATTAACCT 3&#x2019;, : Forward: 5&#x2019; AACGGGTATTGGGAAGACCCTGAA 3&#x2019;, Reverse: 5&#x2019; ATCCCGTCTAACAGGAAGAAGGCT 3&#x2019;, : Forward: 5&#x2019; ACTCCACGGAAGTTCCAA ACACCT 3&#x2019;, Reverse: 5&#x2019; TTCCAGGGTTCTGTGAAGCAGGAT 3&#x2019;, : Forward 5&#x2019; TTCCAGGCTTTGGAGAAGGTGAGT 3&#x2019;, Reverse: 5&#x2019; AGTCTCCTTCGTGGGAATGCTTGT 3&#x2019;, : Forward 5&#x2019; TGCGGCAAAGTATATGGCAAGACC 3&#x2019;, Reverse 5&#x2019; ACTCCTCATGAAACGCTTAGGGCA 3&#x2019;, : Forward 5&#x2019; GAACCAGGCCAAGTGAAACTTGCT 3&#x2019;, Reverse 5&#x2019; AAAGGAGGCTTCCTCTCGGCTAAT 3&#x2019;, : Forward 5&#x2019; GCACTGCAATGCTGCCTTTAGAAC 3&#x2019;, Reverse 5&#x2019; TTTCGCCGGTATGGATCTTCTCGT 3&#x2019;, : Forward 5&#x2019; ACAAGAAGTCACAGCACATGACGG 3&#x2019;, Reverse 5&#x2019; TTCCTTCCACCCGGATAAGATGCT 3&#x2019;, and 19: Forward: 5&#x2019; ATTCCCGGGCTCGTTGCCGGAAAA 3&#x2019;, Reverse: 5&#x2019; ATTGGCAGTACCCTTCCTCTTCCCTA 3&#x2019;. Candidate targets were normalized to 19 expression and fold difference relative to the scrambled control at 48 h post-transfection were calculated. Standard deviations of fold differences of the percentage of reference gene expression were made by comparisons between independent RNA samples. Experiments included no template and no reverse transcriptase controls for each gene. Student&#x2019;s -test was used to calculate -values.. RNA was isolated from a duplicate well for each mock, scrambled control or  transfected experiment to confirm increased  expression in the  transfected cells. qPCR for  expression was conducted as described above.Target prediction programs,  () and  were searched for predicted mRNA targets for  in both mouse and human. Targets for  were prioritized for further study by the number of predicted binding sites per 3&#x2019;UTR (&gt;1 site), strength of binding score, and predicted binding of the miRNA in both human and mouse. A literature scan was also performed to identify targets which had previously been validated experimentally.A5 and B9, mouse cutaneous spindle and cSCC cell lines respectively, and C5N, a non-tumorigenic mouse keratinocyte cell line, were used for these studies (). Cell lines were grown in Dulbecco&#x2019;s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO. Transient transfections were performed using Invitrogen Lipofectamine 2000 according to manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Mock and negative control (scrambled pre-miR) transfections were carried out for all experiments when cells were at 40&#x2013;50% confluency. Scrambled pre-miR (AM17110) negative control and  (AM17150) precursor were purchased from Ambion (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY).Protein from whole cell extracts was extracted 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post-transfection via solubilization of A5 and B9 cells using RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris base pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.10% SDS) containing a protease inhibitor (Roche). For each sample, 30 &#xB5;g of protein were run on a 10% polyacrylamide gel in a Bio-Rad mini-gel system at 150 V (12 V/cm) for &#x223C;1.5 h. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for 70 min at 90 V (7 V/cm). Following transfer, membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBST (10X TBS: 1.2% Tris, 8.8% NaCl) and were incubated with primary antibody overnight. Antibodies and dilutions were as follows: Ets1, 1:1000 dilution (antibody a gift from Michael Ostrowski) and &#x3B1;-tubulin, 1:100 dilution (T5168, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Incubation with secondary antibodies was for 2 h. Secondary antibodies and dilutions were as follows: Anti-mouse HRP-Linked, 1:10000 dilution (W4021, Promega, Madison, WI), Anti-Rabbit HRP-Linked Antibody, 1:1000 dilution, (7074S, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Enhanced chemiluminescent reagent (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) was applied in a 1:1 ratio. Cloning of  3&#x2019;UTR was performed using In-Fusion Advantage PCR Cloning Kit according to manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Full length  plasmid with 3&#x2019;UTR provided by Dr. Michael Ostrowski was used as a template for PCR. A 1,278 base pair product was generated containing the predicted three  binding sites and was cloned into a pGL3 Control Luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Primers used for cloning were as follows:  3&#x2019; UTR In-Fusion Forward: 5&#x2019;-tgtaatactagtccgAGAAGAGAGGCAATTGGCTGAGGT-3&#x2019;,  3&#x2019; UTR In- Fusion Reverse: 5&#x2019;-gtctgctcgaagcggACTGAGGCAGTATTCCTGATAGAG-3&#x2019;. Clones were sequence verified. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to mutate two base pairs in each of the three  binding sites in the  3&#x2019;UTR using QuikChange Lightning Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Primers used for site-direct mutagenesis are as follows: 3&#x2019; UTR SDM 1 Forward: 5&#x2019;-gttgatggctgactcccactctcccttgaagactctgaat-3&#x2019;, 3&#x2019; UTR SDM-1 Reverse: 5&#x2019;-attcagagtcttcaagggagagtgggagtcagccatcaac-3&#x2019;, 3&#x2019; UTR SDM-2 Forward: 5&#x2019;-ccacaaggaagcaaaggccaaactctccagctatatattttgatctta-3&#x2019; , 3&#x2019; UTR SDM-2 Reverse: 5&#x2019;-taagatcaaaatatatagctggagagtttggcctttgcttccttgtgg-3&#x2019;, 3&#x2019; UTR SDM-3 Forward: 5&#x2019;-acctgttgaactcttacgtactctccaaagacgtttcaaggaac-3&#x2019;, 3&#x2019; UTR SDM-3 Reverse: 5&#x2019;-gttccttgaaacgtctttggagagtacgtaagagttcaacaggt-3&#x2019;.Clones were sequenced verified. C5N and A5 cells were plated in triplicate into a 12-well dish at 24 h prior to transfection. At 70% confluency, 0.10 &#xB5;g Luc- 3&#x2019;UTR and Luc- 3&#x2019;UTR-mutated were each co-transfected with 10 pmol of a scrambled control miR or  into each well. 0.10 &#xB5;g of a PRL-TK vector (TK-driven  luciferase vector, Promega) was also transfected into each well to normalize the firefly luciferase values. All experiments included mock and pGL3-Control empty vector controls. A5 and C5N cell lysates were prepared using M-PER (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) and 30 &#xB5;g of each sample were used for analysis. Firefly and renilla luciferase measurements were acquired 24 h post-transfection using a Veristas Microplate Luminometer.At 24 h post-transfection with , scrambled miR control or mock transfected, A5 and B9 cells were trypsinized and 2000 cells (A5) or 3000 cells (B9) were plated in quadruplicate in a 96-well plate. Proliferation was measured at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post-transfection using a MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) cell proliferation kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Experiments were carried out according to manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol. RNA and protein were isolated at each solubilization step. Optimal absorbance of the formazan product was measured at a wavelength of 550 nm and a reference wavelength of 690 nm was used. For each sample, absorbance was normalized to the reference wavelength as well as a blank control, which contained media only.A5 and B9 cells were transfected with , scrambled miR control or mock transfected. Cells were trypsinized and counted 48, 72 and 96 h post-transfection. Two million cells were fixed in 70% ethanol. Cell cycle analysis was evaluated by DNA content.
