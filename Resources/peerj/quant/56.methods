Prior to any breeding attempts, magpies typically form flocks. Once a male and female pair-bond, they seek a territory but may not always succeed and remain semi-nomadic or marginal to a group that occupies a permanent territory (). Only the most successful pairs manage to form and maintain permanent territories and breed successfully (; ; ). Hence, our study involved only groups that occupied permanent territories and produced offspring. We did not need to band the magpies because their wing markings are individually distinct and easily identifiable and we took photographs of these wing markings for reference in later trials. We selected 14 groups with territories that were easily accessible and observable, each group consisting of several magpies (6.2 &#xB1; 0.6, mean and standard error, magpies per group). A total of 87 magpies were part of the study. All groups were located within the city limits of Armidale, New South Wales, Australia (30&#xB0;32&#x2032; S, 151&#xB0;40&#x2032; E). The habitat is best described as open woodland with a combination of native  species and exotic vegetation.The three birds of prey (Little Eagle, Wedge-tailed Eagle and Brown Goshawk) and the Lace Monitor Lizard were taxidermic specimens (). The model snake was made from rubber (130 cm in length and 5.0 cm in circumference at widest point). The snake was dull in colour and resembled two locally extant snake species.Taxidermic specimens presented to the groups of magpies.

This figure has been modified from Figure 1 in .This study was conducted over a 12-month period from September 2005 to August 2006. Testing took place between 07:00 and 11:00 h (Australian Eastern Standard Time). The model predator was covered by a cloth and placed on the ground in or near the centre of the group&#x2019;s territory. The models were stationary and placed on the ground approximately in or near the centre of the group&#x2019;s territory. The experimenter revealed the model by slowly removing the cover, ensuring that the feathers were not disturbed and the model remained in position. He then walked slowly away to at least 20 m from the stimulus and hid behind a nearby structure or tree.We recorded the magpies&#x2019; behaviour for 5 min immediately following their detection of the model predator. Detection was considered to have occurred when at least one magpie approached to within 5 m of the stimulus or emitted an alarm vocalisation, be this a generic or specific eagle alarm call as described elsewhere (). A non-response to the stimulus was recorded when, after 30 min, the magpies did not alarm vocalise or approach.The behaviour of the magpies was videotaped using a Panasonic digital video recorder (NVGS35), with the video frame centred on the model predator and a field of view of at least a 12 m diameter. In addition, observations in the field were noted using pen and paper.Using all five predator models, the groups were tested regularly, covering three stages of juvenile development post-fledging (210 trials). Stage 1: September to December, the juveniles had recently fledged (at this time, offspring are at their most vulnerable) and, for up to 3 months, are still being fed by the adults (). Stage 2: February to April, juveniles aged approximately 5&#x2013;7 months feed independently and move about by themselves or in sibling groups. Stage 3: June to August, juvenile birds begin to disperse (8 to 10 months of age; ). Hence, the three stages of testing signified varying degrees of juvenile dependence on the adults. Each predator model was presented once per group per stage of development (70 trials per stage). The order of presentation of the models was randomised within a testing stage. The interval between trials was at least 48 h per group.Behaviour of each group of magpies was scored from the video footage. The entire group was scored using a continuous sampling technique (), scored per group and as bouts. The following behaviour was scored:(1) Swooping: a flight towards and coming within 1 m of the stimulus, usually approaching the predator from behind. The number of swoops scored included all swooping flights that came within 1 m of the stimulus. Two types of swooping flight patterns were observed: (1a) a direct flight towards the model predator, swooping at it and continuing in the same direction (direct swoop), (1b) a direct flight towards and swooping of the model predator but, instead of continuing in the same direction, the magpie turned in mid air and returned to swoop at the model again in a steep downward flight (looping swoops). Looping and direct swoops were scored separately.(2) Beak claps: performed while on the ground and moving quickly towards the model predator with extension of the magpie&#x2019;s neck so that the beak (generally opened) came close to touching the model and the beak was clapped shut while near the head of the model predator.(3) Jumping: leaping up (approximately 0.5&#x2013;1.5 m above the ground) with one or two flaps of the wings and landing on the ground again without taking flight during the jumping event.(4) Moving around the stimulus (circling) while on the ground at less than 3 m distance from the stimulus.(5) Stationary viewing: the bird was stationary on the ground within 5 m of the model predator and fixating it using one or the other of its lateral fields of vision, often turning the head from side to side for several monocular fixations.The number of magpies present (scored as the number of individuals that approached the model predator within a 5 m radius) and the number of times the birds made physical contact with the models were also scored.Since the number of magpies per group varied, all scores were standardized by dividing the total number of events by the number of magpies present. Using the standardised scores, we used non-parametric tests because our data did not meet the assumptions of parametric tests even after several transformations were attempted. Hence, Friedman&#x2019;s tests were conducted with type of predator as the repeated measure and with each data point representing one trial from one group.All data were analysed using SPSS version 12.0.0 (2003). Bonferroni adjustments were made to account for Type II errors of multiple comparisons.The project had Animal Ethics Approval by the University of New England (AEC05/095, AEC 06/092) and was approved and conducted under license (S10361), by the National Parks and Wildlife Division of New South Wales, Australia.
