The settings for LPT2 were two North American hospitals, one in Toronto, Canada and one in Fort Worth, Texas. The study was approved by the research ethics boards at the University and the participating hospitals. Prior to beginning enrolment at a trial site, the principal investigator and trial coordinator gave presentations to the obstetrical and nursing staff, to ensure everyone understood the protocol. The hospital research nurse followed up with training sessions with the nursing staff, to ensure that all nurses: 1) understood trial procedures (in particular that women in the usual care group were not to be offered hands-and-knees position, and women in the hands-and-knees group were to be encouraged to try hands-and-knees repeatedly during labour); 2) were comfortable with assisting women into hands-and-knees position; and 3) understood the trial enrolment procedure, including accessing the trial website for randomization.The goal was to enrol 60 women, at hospitals in which the regional analgesia used for labour was sufficiently low dose that women could move their legs and safely assume the hands-and-knees position. Eligible women were: nulliparous; &#x2265;37 weeks gestation; in established early labour; anticipating a vaginal delivery of a single fetus in the cephalic position; and competent to give informed consent.Women were excluded if delivery was anticipated within 3&#xA0;h (and thus there would be little opportunity for repeated hands and knees positioning), if they had a medical contraindication or physical limitation such that hands-and-knees position was contraindicated, or if they had a doula or midwife who encouraged the use of hands-and-knees position.Eligible women were identified, informed about the study, and informed consent was obtained from those who were willing to participate. If the woman did not have regional (i.e.&#xA0;epidural or spinal-epidural analgesia) in situ, she was asked if she thought she would want one within the next hour, and if so, enrolment was delayed until after the regional analgesia had been administered. With a 1:1 allocation ratio, randomization was centrally controlled and concealed, using . After collection of baseline data, the nurse accessed the study website to obtain the woman&#x2019;s group assignment.Most of labour occurs in bed, usually in semi-recumbent, sitting, or side-lying positions, although women were permitted/encouraged to be ambulatory if they wished. While women were aware of their options for positioning in labour, they agreed to avoid the hands-and-knees position, or positions that approximate it, such as kneeling in bed and using the head of the bed for support.Immediately after randomization, the woman was assisted into the position and asked to maintain it for a total of at least 15&#xA0;min within a one-hour period. The woman was told she was free to break the 15&#xA0;min into shorter periods, but to aim for at least 15&#xA0;min in total during the first hour. Offering the position in this manner allowed for interruptions for care in the labour setting (e.g.&#xA0;changes of patient gown, recording of vital signs) as well as position changes. Her support person(s) were taught how to assist her into the position. Paper &#x201C;clocks&#x201D; were provided to assist them with estimating the amount of time spent in hands-and-knees. The nurse demonstrated various ways to get into the position in the hospital bed and on the floor, using a birthing ball, pillows, or the head of the bed for upper body support. On an hourly basis, at the time of the nurse&#x2019;s regular visit to the labour room, the woman was asked to consider trying hands-and-knees and assisted into it as needed. She was encouraged to maintain the position for as long as it was comfortable. If the woman found it to be uncomfortable, she was free to get out of the position but encouraged to try it again later in labour. A support person or nurse had to be in attendance while the woman was in the position. Hands-and-knees was to be discontinued if it had a negative impact on the fetal heart rate pattern or maternal blood pressure. Position for delivery was determined by the woman and her care providers and was not dictated by the trial protocol.Prior to the trial onset, we operationally defined compliance with positioning as follows: Women in the hands-and-knees group would try the position at least three times during the hourly intervals between randomization and delivery, and women in the usual care group would not try hands-and-knees position. At hourly visits, a nurse checked the paper &#x201C;clocks&#x201D; and inquired if the participant had used the hands-and-knees position during the previous hour.At trial entry and on an hourly basis, each participant was asked to rate her level of persistent back pain on a numeric rating scale, ranging from 0 (&#x201C;no pain&#x201D;) to 10 (&#x201C;worst pain imaginable&#x201D;), and to indicate whether, compared to one hour ago, the persistent back pain was a lot better, a little better, about the same, a little worse, or much worse.After delivery, each participant was asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire about her experiences. Questionnaire items had been developed and tested in previous trials (;&#xA0;), and included items which compared their expectations to their experiences, and their willingness to participate in the trial if they had it to do over. Those in the hands-and-knees group were also asked to rate the perceived helpfulness of the position.Data about labour, birth, neonatal, and postpartum outcomes were obtained by the hospital research nurses from the participants&#x2019; medical records.Because it was a small pilot trial and not powered to detect differences in outcomes, results were analyzed descriptively.
