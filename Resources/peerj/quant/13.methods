The subjects for this behavioral study were 58 socially-housed squirrel monkeys at the Michale E Keeling Center for Comparative Medicine and Research, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Bastrop, TX, USA (&#x201C;UT MD Anderson&#x201D; hereafter). This study was approved by IACUC (ACUF ID #: 03-12-04281) and UT MD Anderson is fully accredited by AAALAC-I. For all experimental conditions, throughout testing periods, in addition to the food rewards that the monkeys could obtain from the test apparatus, they had  access to both food and water and were never food or water deprived at any time.Twenty-three squirrel monkeys (), socially-housed at UT MD Anderson, were the subjects for this study. The squirrel monkeys were housed in two groups, designated the &#x201C;push-left&#x201D; and &#x201C;push-right&#x201D; groups. The push-right group housed 10 monkeys (9 females, 1 male, average age = 4.1&#xA0;years, range 1&#x2013;15 years) and the push-left group housed 13 monkeys (11 females, 2 males, average age = 2.9&#xA0;years, range 1&#x2013;10&#xA0;years).We note that the two experimental groups for this study were comprised predominantly of females with a few infant males. The social make-up of these groups was designed to reflect wild groups of  in which males emigrate from their natal group () and there is little to no interaction between females and males during the nonbreeding season (). Furthermore, both in captivity and the wild, female  are known to direct aggression toward adult males () and so reducing the number of males within a group can help to alleviate this. This is especially important for a study such as this in which access over a single resource (in this case the test apparatus) may have exacerbated aggression (something that we wished to avoid).Each group lived in large, highly-enriched, cages (1.2&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;1.8&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;4.3&#xA0;m) with many climbing structures to encourage three dimensional use of the cage. Enrichment devices, which were changed every two weeks, were hung throughout and were designed to encourage manipulation and exploration. In addition to the food that the monkeys could obtain for the test apparatus, the monkeys were fed one meal of fresh produce and two meals of New World Primate Diet (Lab Diet, PMI Nutrition International) per day.This group of 13 monkeys comprised 11 females and two males (average age = 2.9&#xA0;years, range 1&#x2013;9&#xA0;years) and was housed in identical conditions as described for the Experimental Groups (tested in the open diffusion condition).Fourteen pair-housed monkeys (8 males and 6 females, average age = 4.3 years, range 1&#x2013;11&#xA0;years) were selected to act as pair controls to test for the influence of social facilitation. These pairs were housed in highly enriched caging (158&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;76&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;64&#xA0;cm) and they followed the same feeding schedule as the group-housed monkeys. Each pair was comprised of monkeys that were familiar with each other.Eight female monkeys (average age = 6.4&#xA0;years, range 5&#x2013;8&#xA0;years) were presented with ghost displays (see Procedure below for more details) to test for the importance of object movement reenactment. For their test, these monkeys were transferred from their large home cage to a smaller cage for their individual tests and returned to their group directly after the completion of the test. Similar to the criteria set for model monkeys to be trained for the Experimental Group Open Diffusion tests (see below), only those monkeys that were comfortable with being isolated (i.e.&#xA0;were calm and would accept food once isolated) were used as subjects for this test condition.The task used for all conditions was a modified Slide-box, a bidirectional task used previously in tests designed to tease apart the social learning mechanisms of chimpanzees and children (; , Figure&#xA0;1). To ensure that the Slide-box was suitable for use with squirrel monkeys we made a smaller version (the front panel was 40&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;30&#xA0;cm) with a door (5&#xA0;cm) that was constructed from a lighter plastic so that it would be easier for the squirrel monkeys to manipulate. The front panel of the Slide-box was transparent plastic. This feature enabled the experimenters to see and code which monkeys (i) operated the task or (ii) observed cagemates move the door. The exception to the clear front was the central door, which was made of opaque red plastic so that when in the central &#x201C;start&#x201D; position, it obscured the platform directly behind it that held the food reward (a mealworm). The door was set on runners so it could move equally well to the right or the left, and either action revealed the mealworm behind the door. This meant that all actions were reinforced equally. Furthermore, the design of this task meant that stimulus enhancement alone could not cue the monkeys which direction to push the door, because the door was in the same starting position for both actions.(A) A diagram of the Slide-box, from the researcher&#x2019;s perspective. The Slide-box is shown in the &#x201C;start&#x201D; position with the door in the center of the runners. With the door in this position it obscures the mealworm, placed on the food platform, from the monkey in the cage behind. (B) A drawing of a squirrel monkey retrieving a meal worm from the Slide-box having pushed the door to her right. For all tests an experimenter held the Slide-box against the mesh of the monkeys&#x2019; cage. The Slide-box was held at 80&#xA0;cm above the ground so that it was a level with a platform within the monkeys&#x2019; cage. This was done so that the monkeys could stand on the platform (see ) while they either used the Slide-box or observed another monkey use the Slide-box. (C) An overview of the experimental set-up. One of the two researchers (R-A) held the Slide-box up against the monkeys&#x2019; cage while the second researcher (R-B) stood directly behind the Slide-box. R-A not only held the Slide-box, but they were also responsible for baiting the Slide-box with a meal worm and re-setting the door of the Slide-box between trials. R-A coded which monkey moved the door of the Slide-box and in which direction they moved the door. R-B coded the identity of all monkeys classed as &#x201C;observers&#x201D; for each trial. A video camera was placed so that it had direct sight of the Slide-box and the monkeys behind.A monkey from each group was selected to act as the model. In the push-right group this monkey was trained to push the door of the Slide-box to the right and in the push-left group the model was trained to push the door to the left. These model monkeys were selected according to the following criteria: they had to be (i) dominant enough to use the task without being usurped and (ii) comfortable being isolated for training.To test the first criterion we presented the monkeys with a clumped food patch on their feeding platform for 10 min (). During this period we noted which animals readily approached the platform and took food and which of those were able to maintain their position and not be displaced by group members. Animals were considered to be dominant if they could maintain access to the food platform regardless of which other monkeys approached. To test the second criterion, we moved the monkey that appeared the most dominant to a cage that adjoined to their home cage. As we did not want their group mates to see the movement of the Slide-box door during the model training sessions, this &#x201C;training cage&#x201D; had opaque sides. In this cage, the monkey being trained was physically separated from their group but still had auditory contact. The monkey that was placed in the training cage was then observed by two experimenters. If the monkey seemed calm and would readily take food from the experimenters, they continued on with their training schedule. If, however, the separated monkey would not take food and/or appeared agitated they were immediately returned to their home cage. Each potential model was given a maximum of two periods in the training cage. If they did not appear calm in either session we commenced this procedure with the monkey that had been rated as the next most dominant. For the push-right group, a three-year-old female was first selected as the model but as she did not appear calm in the training cage we ultimately selected a one-year-old male as the model. The first monkey we selected for the push-left group, a two-year-old female, passed both criteria and was that group&#x2019;s model. We note that the first female sampled, but ultimately rejected, for the role of model for the push-right group never received any experience with the Slide-box. When initially isolated to explore whether she would be a good model, she was never calm enough to take food from the experimenters, and so we did not commence any training with her. Therefore this female had no individual experience with the Slide-box which could have influenced her responses when exposed as an observer in the test sessions. This is critical to verify that all observers were na&#xEF;ve about the task and only received information from the trained model.To train each of the models we used a shaping procedure with positive reinforcement (; ). We first presented the monkey with the Slide-box with the door slid all the way to the edge of the runners appropriate to the door movement that we were training them on. For example, for the monkey being trained to push-left, they were first shown the Slide-box with the door pushed all the way to the left. The monkey was first rewarded for removing the food reward from the Slide-box without having to touch the door. Incrementally, we then moved the door so that it covered more and more of the food-reward hole. In this way, the monkey would have to reach past the door to gain the food reward. This continued until the monkeys were comfortable with touching the door and, eventually, with moving it out of the way to gain the reward.The food rewards used during this training were mealworms, pieces of mini marshmallow and pieces of grape (different to food rewards used during test sessions). Each training session lasted no more than 10 min and, at all other times, both monkeys were housed with their group mates in their home cage. These monkeys each required approximately ten sessions to become familiarized with the training cage and to learn the required behavior. Models were considered &#x201C;trained&#x201D; when he/she was able to push the door of the Slide-box in their designated direction ten times in succession without attempting to move the door in the opposite direction.Both of the experimental groups were given ten 20-min open diffusion sessions. The experimental groups were never tested more than once per day. The Slide-box was presented to the monkeys such that the door was always in the start position in the center of the runners, obscuring the food reward. For the first test session, to ensure that na&#xEF;ve group members observed the seeded technique, and following previous such studies with chimpanzees (e.g., ; ), only the trained model was allowed to use the task for the first ten responses. During this period, if another monkey attempted to use the slide box, the experimenter moved it out of reach. After this controlled observation period, the whole group of monkeys was always allowed free access to interact with the task throughout each of the 20-min sessions. Ultimately, each group received ten 20-min sessions run over a period of two weeks for each group. During these test periods, if a monkey moved the door of the Slide-box they were allowed to get the mealworm on the food tray, following which the experimenter returned the door of the Slide-box to the central position, out of sight of the group to avoid cuing any of the monkeys, and the task was then re-presented to monkeys.The methods for the Control Group were the same as those for the two experimental open diffusion groups except for the fact that there was no trained model monkey. The food reward used throughout was mealworms.Pair-housed monkeys were presented with the Slide-box with no form of demonstration and were given a ten-minute period of free-access with the task (this time was set following the period of time we have used in other social learning controls with primates, e.g., ). These monkeys were allowed to move the door as many times as they could during this ten minute period. All responses were recorded in real-time by the experimenter, including the identity of the monkey which moved the&#xA0;door.For the ghost display four of the monkeys were shown push-left and the other four were shown push-right. For both, the experimenter tied a length of monofilament fishing-line to one side of the door so that it could be moved discretely in one direction ( ). To emulate the scrounging that occurred during the group open diffusion sessions (in both the experimental and control groups), for every fifth door-movement the monkey was allowed access to the reward from the food tray. In this condition monkeys were individually shown 20 ghost displays and were then given a ten-minute free-access period identical to that for the Pair Control, with the exception that the monkeys were singly-housed for this test.The responses of the monkeys in all conditions were coded in real-time but each test was also filmed to enable post hoc coding and analysis if required. Two experimenters (LMH and ANH) were present and involved during the running of each test. For every condition the experimenters coded (i) if a monkey moved the door, (ii) the identity of that monkey and (iii) in which direction they moved the door. In the group sessions we also coded which animals observed their cage mates move the door of the Slide-box, including the identities of all individuals involved in using the box or observing another monkey use it.During the open diffusion tests (the two experimental groups and the Group Control), the two experimenters took turns acting in one of two roles: &#x201C;model coder&#x201D; or &#x201C;observer coder&#x201D;. The model coder was responsible for baiting the apparatus with a mealworm and holding the Slide-box up against the caging so that the front face was flush with the cage mesh. This person also recorded which monkey manipulated the Slide-box door and in which direction they moved it. The second experimenter, the observer coder, recorded every monkey that was within the 40&#xA0;cm area created by the front face of the Slide-box door. This area was easily coded as any monkey which had at least their head within the perimeter of the apparatus, and was oriented towards the Slide-box, was coded as an observer.Each monkey wore a color-coded ID tag, the color of which indicated the age of the monkey. Also on these tags was written the monkey&#x2019;s unique ID number. These were all clearly visible and enabled the experimenters to quickly and clearly identify individual monkeys. To ensure accuracy, prior to running any of the experimental or control tests, the two experimenters ran a series of pilot coding sessions with groups of monkeys that were not tested for this study. For these sessions, both experimenters practiced acting in the roles of model coder and observer coder to ensure that they could accurately and reliably identify the squirrel monkeys. No testing occurred until both coders were in complete agreement in their score sheets (i.e.&#xA0;both coders were coding the identities of monkeys with 100% agreement). The movement of the Slide-box door was extremely clear and easy to code and so there was never disagreement between the two experimenters with regard to this. Furthermore, once the monkeys moved the door in a particular direction they never returned it to its central, starting, position and so when the experimenter removed the Slide-box to reset the door (out of sight of the monkeys) she could further verify the direction it had been moved if needed.Due to the small sample sizes, to compare the level of success (i.e.&#xA0;whether the monkeys moved the door) across conditions we used Fisher&#x2019;s Exact Tests. When comparing the level of matching between the two experimental group conditions we employed the Univariate General Linear Model (SPSS), as not all monkeys made the same number of responses. All tests were two-tailed. To account for potential family-wise errors arising from multiple cross-condition comparisons, we applied a bonferroni correction. When comparing the two experimental groups with the group control we set our &#x3B1;&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.03 (&#x3B1;&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.05/3 conditions).
