In 49 DNA samples sent to the Laboratory for Diagnostic Genome Analysis of the Department of Clinical Genetics (Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden) and in six of the DNA samples sent to the Section Genome Diagnostics of the Department of Genetics (University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen), for the determination of  defects between 2005 and 2011, we found a deletion in the downstream enhancer region of  in 29 probands, and 26 of their relatives (total of 28 families). In the same period in the Laboratory for Diagnostic Genome Analysis of the Department of Clinical Genetics (Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden) we detected 43 deletions of the complete gene, 22 mutations (missense, nonsense, splice site or frameshift) and 5 duplications of  in a total of 1045 patients.With consent of the Medical Ethical Committee of the LUMC, clinical data were collected and anonymized for 44 of the 55 patients (23 index patients and 21 affected relatives from 23 families). Two of the remaining 11 patients were excluded from the analysis of clinical features, because they suffered from an additional disorder, which would probably influence their growth (a skeletal dysplasia of unknown type (inconsistent with LWD), and a deletion 22q11, respectively). For 9 patients no additional clinical data could be obtained.Demographic and clinical data collected were sex, age, height standard deviation score (SDS), sitting height to height ratio SDS and presence of Madelung deformity. Height SDS and sitting height/height SDS were calculated based on Dutch nation-wide references (). We chose not to collect all data needed to calculate the Rappold score (), because of the limitations of this scoring system in clinical practice: arm span, and length and bowing of the forearm are seldom measured by clinicians, appearance of muscular build is not very often spontaneously mentioned in clinical records, and the use of body mass index gives a higher score for obese patients. Instead, we chose to collect data about the classical clinical triad of Leri&#x2013;Weill dyschondrosteosis: height, sitting height to height ratio (SH/H) and presence of Madelung deformity.DNA isolation from peripheral blood and sequence analysis of the  coding region including intron&#x2013;exon boundaries was performed using standard procedures (primer sequences available upon request). Deletions and duplications were detected using the MRC-Holland MLPA kit (Salsa P018-D1) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions.The -test and Fisher exact test were used to test for an association of genotype (deletion including PAR1 probes L05099-L05101 or larger deletions) with height SDS, SH/H SDS, and the presence of a Madelung deformity. Differences between index patients and their relatives were determined, as well as the influence of the gender of the patient.
