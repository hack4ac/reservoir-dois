In each of the sets of protein structures loops, were identified using the following protocol. Secondary structures were annotated using JOY (). A loop structure was defined as any region between two regular secondary structures that was at least three residues in length (). Short (less than 4 residues in length) loops were discarded. Redundancy was removed using sequence identity. If a pair of loops shares over 40% sequence identity (), the loop which has a higher average B-factor was discarded.Membrane proteins (3,789 chains) were extracted from PDBTM (). The membrane layer was defined as being from &#x2212;20 to&#xA0;+&#xA0;20&#xA0;&#x212B;&#xA0;() from the centre of the protein and loops whose two end C atom coordinates were outside the layer were discarded. A total of 1,027 non-redundant membrane loops were defined.All protein chains determined by X-ray crystallography which share less than 99% sequence identity (&lt;3.0&#xA0;&#x212B;&#xA0;resolution and &lt;0.3 R-factor) were collected using PISCES () and all of our 3,789 membrane chains were removed. In order to get rid of any potential membrane chains in the list, PSI-BLAST () was then used to compare the 3,789 membrane chains against the soluble set. Any chains found during 5 iterations with an E-value cut-off of 0.001 were removed from the list of soluble protein chains. A total of 25,191 non-redundant soluble loops were identified from 27,717 soluble protein chains.The loop span () is the distance between the two terminal C atoms of a loop ().Loop span is the separation of the two Cs at either end of the loop. In this example, 2J9O Chain A (198-205) has a span of 13.7&#xA0;&#x212B;&#xA0;and contains 8 residues. Maximum span can be calculated from the number of residues in the loop to be 21.6&#xA0;&#x212B;. Loop stretch is the normalised span (13.7/21.6&#xA0;&#x2243;&#xA0;0.63).The maximum span  is a function of the number of residues  and calculated as follows:  where &#x3B3;&#xA0;=&#xA0;6.046&#xA0;&#x212B; and &#x3B4;&#xA0;=&#xA0;3.46&#xA0;&#x212B;&#xA0;(; ). If the distance between two terminal C atoms in the loop (i.e.&#xA0;the span) is , the loop stretch (&#x3BB;) of the loop is defined as a normalised span. 
            Note that the values of &#x3B3; and &#x3B4; are theoretical approximations so the &#x3BB; of some loops may occasionally be larger than 1. Similar notations are found in , .
