Experiments were conducted according to the national and the EU guidelines for animal care, according to procedures certified by the University of Aarhus. Extracellular f-EPSPs were recorded in response to control stimulation (0.067&#xA0;Hz), in hippocampal slices from adult Wistar rats (about 6 month old) as previously described (). Potentiation was induced by theta-burst stimulation (4 pulses at 100&#xA0;Hz repeated 10 times at 5&#xA0;Hz). f-EPSPs were analysed in terms of post-tetanic changes in the rates of rise of the potentials relative to the pre-tetanic periods of baseline responses (set to 100%). Potentiation was expressed as gain by subtracting the baseline level (100%). Control stimulation was interposed by bursts of 7 stimuli, both before and after the induction of potentiation. Burst-evoked f-EPSPs were analyzed in terms of (1) facilitation (i.e.&#xA0;responses 2 to 7 were normalised to the first response) and (2) potentiation (i.e.&#xA0;the post-tetanic responses 1 to 7 were normalised to their respective mean responses during the baseline).Data are presented both as single experiments and as mean values of experimental groups (&#xB1;S.E.M). Student&#x2019;s t tests, F test, one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA), repeated measures ANOVA (rm-ANOVA) and mixed factorial designs (mfd-ANOVA) were used for the statistic (Prism 5, GraphPad). Bonferroni&#x2019;s (Bmc-test) adjustments were made for multiple comparisons; significant differences were set at &#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;0.05 for all tests.
