KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase was purchased from Novagen (USA), while restriction enzymes were purchased from TAKARA (Japan). GeneJET&#x2122;&#xA0;Plasmid Miniprep and Nucleospin Gel Clean up kits were purchased by Fermentas (USA) and Macherey Nagel (Germany), respectively. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. The substrates lichenan, cellobiose, CMC, laminarin (), 4-methylumbelliferyl &#x3B2;-D-glucopyranoside (MeUmbGlc), methyl-&#x3B2;-D-glucopyranoside, -NPh-&#x3B2;-D-glucopyranoside (-&#x3B2;-NPG), -NPh-&#x3B1;-D-glucopyranoside (-&#x3B1;-NPG), -NPh-&#x3B2;-D-glactopyranoside (-&#x3B2;-NPGal), -NPh-&#x3B1;-D-galactopyranoside (-&#x3B1;-NPGal), -NPh-&#x3B2;-D-cellobioside (-NPCell), were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, (St. Louis, MO). Barley &#x3B2;-glucan and wheat arabinoxylan were purchased from Megazyme. Crystalline cellulose Avicel and birchwood xylan were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).For the cloning of the &#x3B2;-glucosidase gene from ,  One Shot Top10 (Invitrogen, USA) and Zero Blunt PCR Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, USA) were used as the host-vector system.  host strain X-33 and pPICZ&#x3B1;C (Invitrogen, USA) were used for protein expression. The WT strain of  ATCC 42464 was maintained on 1.5% malt-peptone-agar slants at 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C.  was routinely grown in shaking flasks at 30&#xA0;&#xB0;C according to the instructions in the EasySelect&#x2122;&#xA0; Expression Kit (Invitrogen, USA). Genomic DNA was prepared and isolated as previously described ().An / vector, pPICZ&#x3B1;C, was used to achieve secreted expression of bgl3a. pPICZ&#x3B1;C contains the tightly regulated  promoter and the &#xA0;&#x3B1;-factor secretion signal located immediately upstream of the multiple cloning site (). The gene coding for the hypothetical protein Bgl3a (Model ID 66804; chromosome_3:4861135-4863642) was PCR amplified from genomic DNA using primers EF/ER () designed accordingly to the available gene sequence (, DOE Joint Genome Institute, () including the  and  restriction enzyme sites at their respective 5&#x2019;-ends. A high fidelity KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase producing blunt ends was used for the DNA amplification, which was carried out with 30 cycles of denaturation (20&#xA0;s at 95&#xA0;&#xB0;C), annealing (10&#xA0;s at 60&#xA0;&#xB0;C), and extension (50&#xA0;s at 70&#xA0;&#xB0;C), followed by 1 min of further extension at 70&#xA0;&#xB0;C. In order to determine the DNA sequence, the PCR product was cloned into the pCRBlunt vector according to the method described by the Zero Blunt PCR Cloning Kit.Intron removal was achieved using the molecular technique of overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (OEPCR) () using the polymerase KOD Hot Start (Novagen, USA). Two complementary DNA primers per intron, two external primers (EF/EeR, EeF/ER, ) and the appropriate PCR amplification process were used to generate two DNA fragments harbouring overlapping ends. The recombinant plasmid pCRBlunt/, at an appropriate dilution, was used as template DNA and the PCR conditions for each reaction are given as the following: 95&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 2 min, ensued by 30 cycles of 95&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 20&#xA0;s, 60&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 10 s and 70&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 16 s (fragment 407&#xA0;bp) or 20&#xA0;s (fragment 1795&#xA0;bp) respectively, with a final extension step at 70&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 1 min. The two PCR products were combined together in a subsequent hybridization reaction. The generated &#x201C;fusion&#x201D; fragment was amplified further by overlapping PCR through the utilization of the two external primers, EF end ER, with an initial denaturation step at 95&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 2 min, followed by 45 cycles at 95&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 20 s, 60&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 10 s, 70&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 25 s and a final extension step at 70&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 1 min. An extended annealing was performed (25 min) in order to improve base-pairing between the complementary ends of each fragments that have to be fused. The produced  DNA was digested with the enzymes  and  and the DNA fragment gel-purified before cloning into the pPICZ&#x3B1;C vector, resulting in the recombinant pPICZ&#x3B1;C/ which was amplified in  TOP10F&#x2032;, and the transformants were selected by scoring for Zeocin&#x2122;&#xA0;resistance (25&#xA0;&#xB5;g/ml). The recombinant vector pPICZ&#x3B1;C/ was confirmed by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing and finally transformed into .PCR primers for amplification and intron splicing.The recombinant plasmid pPICZ&#x3B1;C/ was linearized with , and then transformation of  and cultivation in shaken flasks were performed according to the EasySelect&#x2122;&#xA0; Expression Kit. High-level expression transformants were screened from the YPDS plates containing Zeocin&#x2122;&#xA0;at a final concentration of 100&#xA0;&#xB5;g/ml. The presence of the  gene in the transformants was confirmed by PCR using yeast genomic DNA as template and gene specific primers (EF and ER; ).To screen the  transformants for &#x3B2;-glucosidase expression, 50 colonies were plated out on MM (1.34% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, 4&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;10% (w/v) biotin and 0.5% (v/v) MeOH top agar at a density of 1 colony/cm. After incubation at 30&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 24&#xA0;h, the plates were overlaid with 4&#xA0;ml of 1% agarose containing 10&#xA0;mM MeUmbGlc and incubated at room temperature for up to 5 min. The plates were inspected regularly under UV light for fluorescent haloes surrounding recombinant colonies, which is indicative of MeUmbGlc hydrolysis.For the quantification of &#x3B2;-glucosidase activity found in the fluorescent positive  colonies, the different transformants were cultivated in BMGY medium for 18&#x2013;24&#xA0;h, at 30&#xA0;&#xB0;C in a shaker (200 rpm) and then inoculated into the production medium BMMY reaching OD&#xA0;=&#xA0;1. The extracellular secreted protein was tested for &#x3B2;-glucosidase activity after 24 h of incubation at 30&#xA0;&#xB0;C and 200 rpm.The best recombinant  harbouring  gene was grown and harvested, as previously described (). The cultures were kept in a shaking incubator at 30&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 6 days (200 rpm) with the addition of 0.75&#xA0;ml methanol once a day to maintain induction (0.5% v/v).The recombinant  harbouring  gene was grown and harvested, as previously described (). The cultures were kept in a shaking incubator at 30&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 6 days (200 rpm) with the addition of 0.75&#xA0;ml methanol once a day to maintain induction (0.5% v/v).For the purification of the recombinant &#x3B2;-glucosidase, 800 ml of culture broth was centrifuged and concentrated 30-fold using an Amicon ultrafiltration apparatus (Amicon chamber 8400 with membrane Diaflo PM-30, exclusion size 30 kDa), (Millipore, Billerica, USA). The concentrate was dialyzed overnight at 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C against a 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 300 mM NaCl (pH 8.0) and loaded onto a immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) column (Talon, Clontech; 1.0&#xA0;cm i.d., 15&#xA0;cm length) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was first washed with 300 ml buffer, then a linear gradient from 0 to 100 mM imidazole in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 300 mM NaCl (60 ml, pH 8.0) was applied at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Fractions (2 ml) containing &#x3B2;-glucosidase activity were concentrated and the homogeneity was checked by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 10% acrylamide separating gels. For the determination of isoelectric point (pI), isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed with the Phastsystem using PhastGel IEF (Amersham Biosciences AB) using broad-range IEF markers (pH 3&#x2013;9) from Pharmacia. Both gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue G-250.The &#x3B2;-glucosidase activity was determined by incubating the enzyme with -&#x3B2;-NPG. The enzymatic reaction mixtures (1&#xA0;ml) containing 50&#xA0;&#xB5;l of enzyme solution and 1&#xA0;mM -&#x3B2;-NPG (final concentration) in 0.1 M citrate-phosphate buffer pH 5.0 were incubated for 10 min at 50&#xA0;&#xB0;C. The amount of -nitrophenol ( NP) released was measured at , after addition of 0.2&#xA0;ml 1&#xA0;M  to the reaction mixtures, using a standard curved prepared under the same conditions.The optimal temperature was determined using the standard assay procedure at temperatures ranging from 30 to 80&#xA0;&#xB0;C in 0.1 M citrate-phosphate buffer pH 5.0. Temperature stability was determined by measuring the residual activity under the standard assay procedure, after incubation of purified bgl3a at various temperatures for different amount of time in 50 mM MOPS buffer (pH = 6.5) in the presence of 1&#xA0;mg/ml BSA. The optimal pH was determined by the standard assay at 50&#xA0;&#xB0;C over the pH range 3.0&#x2013;11.0 using either 0.1 M citrate-phosphate buffer pH 3.0&#x2013;7.0, 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7&#x2013;9 or 0.1 M glycine-NaOH buffer pH 9&#x2013;11. The stability at different pH was determined after incubating the enzyme in the above buffers at 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 4&#xA0;h and then measuring the activity remaining using the standard assay.The substrate specificity of bgl3a against -&#x3B1;-NPG, -&#x3B2;-NPGal, -&#x3B1;-NPGal was tested with reaction mixtures containing 0.064 mg bgl3a and 5 mM of each substrate under the standard assay conditions. Enzyme activity on -NPCell was tested at the same conditions, using 1&#xA0;mM substrate. Enzyme activity on multiple polysaccharide substrates (lichenan, barley &#x3B2;-glucan, laminarin, Avicel) or birchwood xylan was also investigated. Enzyme activity was determined after incubation in 0.1 M citrate-phosphate buffer (pH&#xA0;5.0) containing 1.0% of each substrate at 50&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 15 min. The amount of reducing sugars released was estimated using the dinitrosalicylic acid reagent (DNS) (), using D-glucose for the standard curve. The activity on cellobiose was estimated by assaying the amount of released D-glucose using GOD&#x2013;POD method (). One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme which released 1&#xA0;&#xB5;mol of D-glucose equivalents or -nitrophenol ( NP) per min under assay conditions. The protein was determined by the absorbance at 280 nm using molar extinction coefficient of 115655&#xA0;M&#xA0;cm&#xA0;().The values of the Michaelis constant () and the maximum velocity () for bgl3a were determined by incubating the enzyme in 100 mM citrate-phosphate buffer pH 5.0 at 40&#xA0;&#xB0;C with -&#x3B2;-NPG and cellobiose at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10&#xA0;mM. The inhibition of bgl3a by D-glucose and xylose was determined by assay the enzymatic activity on -&#x3B2;-NPG in the presence of different inhibitor concentrations. Data were fitted to the Michaelis&#x2013;Menten equation to generate estimates of values for ,  and , using GraFit data analysis software that also gives an estimate of the standard error of each parameter ().The effect of D-gluconic acid produced by oxidation of D-glucose on the activity of bgl3a was examined. Chemical conversion of D-glucose to aldonic acid/lactone took place through a mild oxidation method that has been shown to selectively oxidize the hemiacetal carbon (C1) of carbohydrates to generate aldonic acids (). The inhibition of bgl3a by D-gluconic acid was determined by assay the enzymatic activity on -&#x3B2;-NPG, as described above.The effects of various metal ions or other substances at 10 mM on bgl3a activity were determined by preincubating the enzyme with the individual compounds in 100 mM citrate-phosphate buffer pH 5.0 at 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 40 min. Activities were then measured at 50&#xA0;&#xB0;C, under standard assay conditions, in the presence of the metal ions or chemical agents. The activity assayed in the absence of metal ions or agents was recorded as 100%.The effect of alcohols (ethanol, methanol and propanol) as strong nucleophile reagents on the hydrolysis of -&#x3B2;-NPG was studied. Reaction mixtures containing 1&#xA0;mM -&#x3B2;-NPG in 100 mM citrate phosphate buffer, pH 5.0, with varying concentrations of short chain alcohols were incubated at 50&#xA0;&#xB0;C and the activity was measured under standard assay conditions. The stability at various concentrations of ethanol up to 50% (v/v) at 30&#xA0;&#xB0;C was determined, after incubating the enzyme in 100 mM citrate-phosphate buffer pH 5.0 for 6&#xA0;h and then measuring the residual activity using the standard assay. Transglycosylation activity was examined using cellobiose as a donor and methanol as an acceptor. A 2&#xA0;ml incubation mixture contained 20% (v/v) of methanol, 0.02%  and different concentrations of cellobiose (1, 2, 4, 5 and 6% w/v) in 0.1 M citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 5.0 and 64&#xA0;&#xB5;g mg of enzyme was used. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 50&#xA0;&#xB0;C and samples were withdrawn at different time intervals for 5 h. Methyl-D-glucoside synthesis was monitored by employing an HPLC system (Shimadzu LC-20AD) equipped with a refractive index detector (Shimadzu RID 10A) and a Macherey-Nagel CC 250 &#xD7; 4.6&#xA0;mm Nucleosil 100-5 NH2 column. The mobile phase was acetonitrile:water (87:13 v/v) and the sugars were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, as described previously (). The products were quantified based on peak areas using standard methyl-&#x3B2;-D-glucopyranoside, D-glucose and cellobiose.
