Eight subjects (5 males, 3 females) with normal or corrected-to-normal vision participated in the experiments. Experiments were carried out under the guidelines of the Barrow Neurological Institute&#x2019;s Institutional Review Board (protocol number 04BN039). Written informed consent was obtained from each subject.Depending on the experiment, either binocular or monocular eye position was acquired noninvasively at 500&#xA0;Hz with an infrared video tracker (EyeLink II, SR Research).We measured OMT using the piezoelectric transduction method introduced by  and refined by  and . A silicone tipped piezoelectric bimorph was brought into contact with the sclera in the interpalpebral region near the temporal limbus. The voltage generated across the bimorph was amplified by a high input impedance instrumentation amplifier and digitized via a low noise 24-bit analog-to-digital converter (102&#xA0;dB dynamic range, variable anti-aliasing filter, sampling frequency 2500&#xA0;Hz) to provide sufficient resolution and dynamic range to capture microsaccades and OMT.We mounted the piezoelectric sensor on the EyeLink II helmet to record eye position simultaneously with the two systems (). Each subject laid supine on a hospital bed, looking up at a horizontally down-facing LCD monitor  from the subject. A licensed physician applied a drop of topical anesthetic (proparacaine) to the eye(s) that was/were to have a piezoelectric bimorph. The eyelid(s) of the eye(s) that was/were to have a piezoelectric bimorph was/were then retracted using polyethylene surgical tape. We then let the silicone tipped piezoelectric bimorph rest on the sclera () for a maximum of two sequential 40-s trials. Subjects performed one of two experimental tasks (Troxler fading or simple fixation; see Experiments section for details).(A) The piezoelectric sensor was mounted to the Eyelink II helmet. (B) Close up of the sensor on the eye in the EyeLink II recording screen. Eyelink II could track the subject&#x2019;s pupil successfully (blue pixels inside the green box) despite the presence of the sensor. (C) 5&#xA0;s of raw EyeLink II data (top) and microsaccadic component of the simultaneous piezoelectric recording (bottom). Notice the good correspondence between microsaccades (quick eye position jumps) detected with Eyelink II and the spikes from the microsaccadic component (i.e.&#xA0;a filtered version of the raw data; see Materials and Methods for details) of the piezoelectric recording. The -axis applies to the EyeLink data only.Subjects fixated a small red spot (0.2&#xB0;&#xA0;radius) on the center of the screen. Before the application of the piezoelectric sensor(s), we conducted a baseline recording of eye movements with EyeLink II. Next, we applied anesthetic drops to the eye(s) that was/were to have a sensor, followed by placement of surgical tape. Then, we lowered the sensor(s) onto the eye(s). We recorded two 40&#xA0;s trials with the piezoelectric sensor in one or both eyes, followed by a few recovery trials after sensor removal. To account for the potential effects of the topical anesthetic and surgical tape on the eye movement measurements, we recorded some trials in the presence of anesthetic and surgical tape, without the piezoelectric sensor.This experiment consisted of monocular recordings only (we patched the eye without the piezoelectric sensor). Otherwise the experimental procedure was as above, except that subjects continuously reported whether a visual target was faded/fading (button press) or intensified/intensifying (button release) while fixating the central red spot (; ). The visual target () was a two-lobe Gabor patch with a peak-to-trough width of 2.5&#xB0;&#xA0;(Gaussian standard deviations of &#xA0;=&#xA0;1.5&#xB0; and &#xA0;=&#xA0;1&#xB0;; sine wave period of 5&#xB0;; sine wave phase of 0), maximum contrast of 40% from peak-to-trough and same average luminance (50%) as the background (; ). The Gabor was presented at 0&#xB0;&#xA0;or 9&#xB0;&#xA0;of eccentricity measured from the center of the fixation point to the center of the Gabor. The orientation of the Gabor varied randomly between 0&#xB0;&#xA0;and 360&#xB0;&#xA0;in each trial, to control for orientation adaptation effects. The position of the Gabor also varied randomly across trials (at one of the eight points of the compass) in the 9&#xB0;&#xA0;eccentricity condition, to control for possible contrast adaptation effects. After 40&#xA0;s, the stimuli disappeared and the trial ended. To disregard the potential effect of the initial stimulus onset transient at the start of each trial, we conducted analyses only on data recorded after the first second of the trial.We identified and removed blink periods as portions of the raw data where pupil information was missing. We also removed portions of data where very fast decreases and increases in pupil area occurred (&gt;50 units/sample, such periods are probably semi-blinks where the pupil is never fully occluded) (). We added 200&#xA0;ms before and after each blink/semi-blink to eliminate the initial and final parts where the pupil was still partially occluded (). We identified saccades with a modified version of the algorithm developed by Engbert &amp; Kliegl (; ; ; ; ) with &#x3BB;&#xA0;=&#xA0;6 (used for the velocity threshold detection) and a minimum saccadic duration of 6&#xA0;ms. To reduce the amount of potential noise, we considered only binocular saccades during binocular recordings; that is, saccades with a minimum overlap of one data sample in both eyes (; ; ; ). Additionally, in all recording conditions, we imposed a minimum intersaccadic interval of 20&#xA0;ms, so that potential overshoot corrections might not be categorized as new saccades (). We imposed a maximum microsaccadic magnitude of 2&#xB0;&#xA0;in both eyes (; ; ; ). Microsaccade properties (i.e.&#xA0;magnitude, peak velocity) heretofore described were calculated from the EyeLink II data.The raw output of a piezoelectric probe on the eye shows the continual, high frequency OMT signal riding on a larger amplitude low frequency signal, consisting of drift and background movement, interspersed with sharp, short, intermittent microsaccades. OMT was defined as vibrations in the 20&#xA0;Hz to 150&#xA0;Hz band in the piezoelectric signal output. Simple bandpass filtering of the signal to isolate OMT can cause ringing artifacts in response to microsaccades, whereas cutting out microsaccades causes short periods of data loss. To avoid these issues, a wavelet denoising technique was used to separate the microsaccadic component from the piezoelectric output () (). In this technique, the OMT and drift components are initially treated as &#x201C;noise&#x201D; in the raw piezoelectric signal. The raw signal is transformed to obtain UWT (Undecimated Wavelet Transform) coefficients. The smaller coefficients correspond to signal noise, in this case OMT and drift. The coefficients are thresholded, with coefficients below the threshold set to zero and those above the threshold left unchanged. The threshold levels for denoising were calculated from the universal threshold approach using multiple level rescaling for variance estimation (). An inverse transform is then applied to the thresholded coefficients and the recovered signal contains only the microsaccadic elements. To obtain a microsaccade &#x201C;free&#x201D; trace (), this signal is then subtracted from the original raw piezoelectric signal, leaving only the OMT and drift components of the trace. This trace is then band passed using a 20&#x2013;150&#xA0;Hz digital bandpass elliptical digital filter to remove drift and to isolate OMT.Some piezoelectric sensor data was discarded because technical difficulties with the probe resulted in poor signal, resulting in a total of 15 trials across subjects in the Troxler fading experiment ().We correlated microsaccade production to the subjects&#x2019; perceptual reports, as in . Briefly, let  and  be the stochastic processes representing the onsets of microsaccades and intensification reports. For example, if ,&#xA0;,&#xA0;&#x2026;,&#xA0; are the start times of all the microsaccades for a given subject, then  for that subject will be given by ()&#xA0;=&#xA0;1 if &#xA0;=&#xA0; for some 1&#xA0;&#x2264;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#x2264;&#xA0;,&#xA0;and ()&#xA0;=&#xA0;0 otherwise; similarly for . We obtained correlations of microsaccades with reports of intensification for each subject, using  and then converting it to a rate (similarly for correlations of microsaccades with reports of fading). For each subject, correlations were smoothed using a Savitzky&#x2013;Golay filter of order 1 and a window size of 151&#xA0;ms ( and  were not smoothed). Average correlations are the average of the smoothed correlations (). OMT correlations with reports of perceptual transitions were obtained in a similar fashion.To analyze the effect of the piezoelectric sensor on microsaccade magnitude and rate, we conducted separate single-factor repeated measures ANOVAs (one for each dependent variable) with the three measuring times (before sensor, during sensor, and after sensor) as the within-subjects factor. We conducted post hoc comparisons using Tukey HSD tests. To study the effect of the surgical tape and anesthetic on microsaccade magnitude, we used separate two-tailed paired -tests (one for each dependent variable). To analyze the effect of the probe on the microsaccadic peak velocity&#x2013;magnitude relationship, we used a two-tailed paired -test on the slopes found from the robust linear regressions, for each subject. The significance level was set at &#x3B1;&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.05. We analyzed the effect of the sensor, tape, and anesthetic on microsaccades using data from the fixation experiment only.
