We collected data from seven specimens of  and five specimens of  for comparison. Approval for this study was granted from the University of Utah Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), protocol number 10-12003.  were obtained post mortem (varied, natural causes but no respiratory pathology) from the conservation and breeding center &#x201C;La ferme aux crocodiles&#x201D; (Pierrelatte, France), with specimen identifiers FNC6 (10.1 kg), NNC1 (3.2 kg), NNC3 (1.01 kg), NNC4 (14.6 kg), NNC5 (0.5 kg), NNC6 (0.8 kg), and NNC9 (0.58 kg). The five alligators were obtained from the Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge in Louisiana: 2.3 kg, 3.6 kg, 5.4 kg, 3.6 kg, 11 kg, and 64 inches long (mass unknown). The  lungs were excised and soaked in an iodine potassium iodide (I2KI) solution at concentrations varying from 2.25&#x2013;3.75% () prior to the CT scans. NNC5 and NNC6 were inflated and scanned in a medical grade CT unit at the Royal Veterinary College, London at 90 kVp and 133MA with a slice thickness of 0.75 mm; NNC9 was scanned in a micro CT unit at the University of Cambridge with a slice width of 0.0816 mm. We imaged live unsedated adult alligators during a natural apnea phase at the University of Utah Medical Center using a 164 slice dual energy Siemens SOMATOM Definition computed tomography unit. Image acquisition parameters: slice thickness = 0.6 mm and 1 mm, kVp 120, MA 200. The pulmonary bronchi were segmented into a 3D model from DICOM image files with the visualization software Avizo 7.To measure flow, dual heated thermistor airflow probes were individually implanted in each of the secondary bronchi () after the anatomy was mapped out using computed tomography and Avizo 7.0 software. The probe was connected to an air flow meter (HEC 132C Thermistor Flowmeter, Hector Engineering Co., Inc., Elletsville, IN), and the signal transformed from analog to digital (Biopac Systems Inc, Goleta, CA), and then recorded on a MacIntosh G4 Powerbook laptop using AcqKnowledge software (Biopac Systems Inc, Goleta, CA). Airflow in and out of the trachea was measured with a pneumotach (Hans Rudolph Inc., Shawnee, KS). Measuring airflow in excised lungs in crocodilians has been validated and produces the same results as  experiments (; ); thus only  lungs were used here. Once the probe was in place (), air was pushed into the excised lung using a syringe to measure airflow in and out of the primary and secondary bronchi.Excised lungs from a 3.1 kg Nile crocodile (NNC1; ) demonstrating probe placement, head is to the right.
