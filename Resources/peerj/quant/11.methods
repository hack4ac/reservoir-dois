A literature search was conducted on all available published literature up to the 2nd August 2012 in Scopus () for literature with the keywords: &#x201C;clim* change and insect&#x201D;, &#x201C;clim* change and [each of the insect order names and generally used common names]&#x201D;. Citations and abstracts were downloaded for 4704 studies. Studies that had these keywords ranged in years from 1924 to online early publications (August 2012). Each abstract was then examined to determine if it was appropriate for further assessment, and a PDF reprint was then downloaded. Scopus also adds keywords in addition to the authors&#x2019; keywords, with many articles not actually referring to climate change, in any part of their study. If climate change (or equivalent term) was not referred to in the study (abstract or main body) it was not included in the assessment. The number of publications was then culled down to 1703 ranging in years from 1985 to online early (2nd August 2012). If studies were deemed appropriate, a range of information was extracted as shown in . Number of species in each order that have been formally identified as of 2010 was generated from . The papers assessed and data extracted was uploaded onto FigShare .Categories given to each study for data type, region, the main climatic drivers that authors identified, the type of information that authors collected and presented in their results, and the habitat in which the study was carried out.
