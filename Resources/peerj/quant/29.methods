Hibernation experiments were conducted by the laboratory of Dr. J.M. Hallenbeck at the Animal Hibernation Facility, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NIH, Bethesda, MD), as described by . Briefly, thirteen-lined ground squirrels (, weighing 150&#x2013;300&#xA0;g, were wild-captured by a United States Department of Agriculture-licensed trapper (TLS Research, Bloomingdale, IL) and transported to the NIH. Animal housing and experimental procedures followed the guidelines set by the NINDS animal care and use committee (ACUC). Animals were individually housed in shoebox cages at 21&#xA0;&#xB0;C and fitted with a sensor chip (IPTT-300; Bio Medic Data Systems) injected subcutaneously while anesthetized with 5% isofluorane. Animals were fed standard rodent diet and water  until they gained sufficient lipid stores to enter hibernation. To enable a natural transition into torpor, animals were transferred to an environmental chamber at &#x223C;5&#xA0;&#xB0;C in constant darkness. Body temperature (), time and respiration rate were monitored and used to determine sampling points. All animals had been through a series of torpor-arousal bouts prior to sampling. Animals were sampled as in  and tissue samples were shipped to Carleton University on dry ice. Tissues were stored at &#x2212;80&#xA0;&#xB0;C until use. EC designates euthermic, cold room; these euthermic squirrels had a stable  (&#x223C;37&#xA0;&#xB0;C) in the 5&#xA0;&#xB0;C cold room, were capable of entering torpor but had not done so in the past 72&#xA0;h. LT designates late torpor; animals that were constantly in deep torpor for at least 5 days with  values of 5&#x2013;8&#xA0;&#xB0;C.Samples of frozen tissues (brown adipose, skeletal and cardiac muscle, liver, kidney, brain) from two sampling points (EC and LT) were separately extracted (&#xA0;=&#xA0;4&#x2013;5 samples from different animals). Tissues were quickly weighed, crushed into small pieces under liquid nitrogen, and then homogenized 1:3 w:v using a Polytron PT10 in ice-cold homogenizing buffer (20 mM Hepes, 200 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM NaV O, 10&#xA0;mM &#x3B2;-glycerophosphate) with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (BioShop) and 1&#xA0;&#xB5;l protease inhibitor cocktail (BioShop) added immediately before homogenization. Each sample was centrifuged for 10 min (12,000&#xA0;g, 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C), the supernatant containing soluble proteins was removed, and the protein concentration was determined by the Coomassie blue dye-binding method (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) using a MR5000 microplate reader. Samples were adjusted to a constant 4&#xA0;&#xB5;g/&#xB5;l by addition of small amounts of homogenizing buffer and then aliquots were combined 1:1 v:v with 2X SDS loading buffer (100 mM Tris-base pH 6.8, 4% w:v SDS, 20% v:v glycerol, 0.2% w:v bromophenol blue, 10% v:v 2-mercaptoethanol) and boiled. Final protein samples (2&#xA0;&#xB5;g/&#xB5;l) were stored at &#x2212;40&#xA0;&#xB0;C until use.Equal amounts of protein from each sample (20&#x2013;30&#xA0;&#xB5;g protein/well) were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) or Tris-tricine gels and separated on a BioRad Mini Protean III apparatus. Discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gels were used with a 5% stacking gel pH 6.8 and a 10% resolving gel pH 8.8. For Tris-tricine gels, the stacking gel was composed of 375&#xA0;&#xB5;l 3.0 M Tris-HCl/SDS (pH 8.45), 253&#xA0;&#xB5;l 30% acrylamide, 875&#xA0;&#xB5;l water, 15&#xA0;&#xB5;l 10% APS, 1.5&#xA0;&#xB5;l TEMED whereas the 15% resolving gel contained 1.875 mL 3.0 M Tris-HCl/SDS (pH 8.45), 2.875 mL 30% acrylamide, 316&#xA0;&#xB5;l water, 112&#xA0;&#xB5;l 10% APS, 3.5&#xA0;&#xB5;l TEMED. The Tris-tricine 10X anode buffer was 2 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.8 and the 10X running buffer was 1 M Tris-HCl, 1 M Tricine, 1% w/v SDS, pH 8.3. For detection of Bcl-2, samples were loaded on 15% Tris-tricine gels and run at 30 V for 1 h followed by &#x223C;2&#xA0;h at 150 V. Other proteins were separated by standard SDS-PAGE using either 12% (Bcl-xL, BI-1) or 10% (cIAP, xIAP, Mcl-1) gels run at 180 V for 45&#x2013;60 min. Proteins were then transferred to PVDF membrane (0.2 micron PVDF for transfer of Tris-tricine gels and 0.45&#xA0;&#xB5;m PVDF for all others) by electroblotting at 160 mA for 1&#x2013;1.5&#xA0;h using a transfer buffer containing 25 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 192 mM glycine and 10% v:v methanol at room temperature.Membranes were blocked with either milk (2%&#x2013;5% w:v) or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) made up in TBST (20 mM Tris base, pH 7.6, 140 mM NaCl, 0.05% v:v Tween-20). Those blocked with milk were incubated on a rocker for 20&#x2013;40 min (Bcl-xL, cIAP, xIAP, p53, Bcl-2 all forms). When PVA was used, incubation was with 1 mg/ml PVA (70&#x2013;100&#xA0;kDa or 30&#x2013;70&#xA0;kDa) in TBST for 45&#xA0;s (Mcl-1, BI-1). Membranes were then probed with specific primary antibodies at 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 12&#x2013;24&#xA0;h. Antibodies were carefully selected from suppliers with the following criteria: antibodies cross-react with several model organisms and the epitope correlates with highly conserved protein regions. Antibodies were diluted 1:1000 v:v in TBST (0.05% Tween-20) except for xIAP and cIAP1/2 which were 1:200 v:v dilution. Membranes that had been probed with Bcl-2, p-Bcl-2 S70, p-Bcl-2 T56, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 or p-p53 S46 antibodies were then incubated with HRP-linked anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:4000 v:v dilution); HRP-linked anti-goat IgG secondary antibody (1:8000 v:v dilution) was used for cIAP1/2 and BI-1 and HRP-linked anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:2000 v:v dilution) was used for xIAP. All membranes were washed between incubation periods in TBST for &#x223C;10&#xA0;min per wash. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence ( and luminol) and then blots were restained using Coomassie blue (0.25% w:v Coomassie brilliant blue, 7.5% v:v acetic acid, 50% methanol). Antibodies specific for mammalian BI-1 and cIAP1/2 were purchased from Santa Cruz, xIAP was from Stressgen, and all others were from Cell Signaling including phospho-specific antibodies detecting Bcl-2 phosphorylated on S70 or T65 and p53 phosphorylated on S46. Antibodies each cross-reacted with single strong bands on the immunoblots at the expected molecular masses for Bcl-2 (26 kDa), Bcl-xL (30 kDa), cIAP (69 kDa), xIAP (53 kDa), p53 (53 kDa), Mcl-1 (40 kDa), and BI-1 (27 kDa) (). Using online bioinformatics tools, it was confirmed that the predicted molecular weight of the target ground squirrel proteins are similar to those from other model organisms.The targets of interest are labeled to the left and the tissue to the right of the gel. The antibodies cross-reacted with single strong bands on the immunoblots at the expected molecular masses for the following proteins: Bcl-2 (26 kDa), Bcl-xL (30 kDa), cIAP (69 kDa), xIAP (53 kDa), p53 (53 kDa), Mcl-1 (40 kDa), and BI-1 (27 kDa). In samples from the liver and brain the first 3 bands represent EC state and the next 4 bands represent LT state.Band densities on chemiluminescent immunoblots were visualized using a Chemi-Genius BioImaging system (Syngene, Frederick, MD) and quantified using the associated Gene Tools software. Immunoblot band density in each lane was standardized against the summed intensity of a group of Coomassie stained protein bands in the same lane; these were chosen because they did not show variation between different experimental states and were not located close to the protein bands of interest. Data are expressed as means&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;SEM, &#xA0;=&#xA0;3&#x2013;4 independent samples from different animals. Statistical testing of standardized band intensities used the Student&#x2019;s -test (&#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;0.05).
