The Liaogeng (LG) and Kitaake japonica rice ( L) cultivars were used for this study. LG and Kitaake rice are both susceptible to the Philippine  strain PXO99. Rice plants were grown in green houses at UC Davis at 27&#x2013;32&#xA0;&#xB0;C under natural sunlight. For  inoculation, 5&#x2013;6 weeks old plants were transferred to a growth chamber and inoculated with PXO99 by the scissor-dip method ().  population measurements were conducted as described before (). Growth chambers were set at 28&#xA0;&#xB0;C with a day/night time cycle of 14&#xA0;h/10&#xA0;h.The rice  gene was obtained from a yeast two-hybrid screen (). The first 800 nt of the cDNA clone (named GIF15), which contained a full-length  cDNA, was cut out from the pAD-Gal4 prey vector using EcoRI at the 5&#x2019; end and PstI internal in the  cDNA. This excised fragment (ca. 800 bp) was purified and cloned into the PstI site in the pBlueScript II SK- vector by a three-piece ligation, together with the Xa21 intron (ca. 840 bp) precut with EcoRI at both ends. The Xa21 intron was used as a spacer to stabilize the construct. The Xa21 intron was originally amplified with primers Xa21int-1 (5&#x2019;AAGTCGACGAATTCCAGGTCAGCAAGTCCTTCC) and Xa21int-2 (5&#x2019;AAGTCGACGAATTCATACTCTGTTTGAGCAGGA) and cloned into pBlueScript II SK-. The resulting clone was named dsGLO1/SK. The dsGLO1 insert was excised with BamHI and KpnI and subcloned into the Ubi-C1300 binary vector (), resulting in plasmid Ubi-dsGLO1.For the dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible, GVG (Gal4 DNA binding domain-VP16 activation domain-glucocorticoid receptor fusion)-driven construct (), the same dsGLO1 insert was excised with XhoI and SpeI and cloned into the TA7002 binary vector precut with the same enzymes, yielding construct GVG-dsGLO1.For induction, GVG-dsGLO1 and control Kitaake rice plants are foliar-sprayed with  DEX one day before leaf tissue collection or two days before Xoo inoculation. DEX was first dissolved in 1&#xA0;mL of DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) then dissolved in 150&#xA0;mL 0.05% Tween 20.Leaf samples were frozen and kept at &#x2212;80&#x2009;&#xB0;C until use. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Sigma) with 1 mL of Trizol per half leaf. RNA was precipitated with isopropanol, rinsed with 70% ethanol, and air-dried. RNA was resuspended in  of RNase-free water and digested with DNase I in a volume of . RNA was further extracted with  of Trizol to remove DNase I and purified with NucleoSpin RNA II columns (E&amp;K Scientific). cDNA was synthesized using  of total RNA. Synthesized cDNA was treated with RNase H and RNase A and purified with a DNA clean &amp; concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research) before use.RNA blot analysis followed the procedure described before (). The 3&#x2019; fragment of GLO1 cDNA beyond the region used for silencing (see above) was used as probe in the RNA blot analysis of GLO1. Quantitative RT&#x2013;PCR was carried out as described before (). Real time PCR reactions were performed on a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time System coupled to a C1000 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad). The actin transcript level was used as the reference in real time RT&#x2013;PCR experiments. Rice actin real time PCR used primers Actin-QF (5&#x2019;CAGCCACACTGTCCCCATCTA) and Actin-QR (5&#x2019;AGCAAGGTCGAGACGAAGGA). For quantification of gene expression of individual GLO genes, gene-specific primers were designed for each GLO gene. GLO1 used primers GLO1-RT4 (5&#x2019;CTCCTGCCTTGTGAACCCTG) and GLO1-RT5 (5&#x2019;GTGCAGAAACTCAAAGATCTCTC). GLO2 used primers GLO2-RT4 (CTCTGCTCAAGTCATCACCA) and GLO2-RT5 (CCATTCTTCTTGATTGCATGGCT). GLO3 used primers GLO3-RT4 (5&#x2019;CCATCTTCGCGCTGAGCTAG) and GLO3-RT5 (5&#x2019;TGCTTGGTCATCACCCTCATC). GLO4 used GLO4-RT4 (TGTCCTCCATTTCTGCACTAC) and GLO4-RT5 (GGCATTGTTTTGATGGTTTGTGTG). NH1 RT PCR used primers NH1-RT3 (5&#x2019;CTGATCCGGTTTCCCTCGGA) and NH1-RT4 (5&#x2019;GACCTGTCATTCTCCTCCTTG). NH3 RT&#x2013;PCR used NH3-RT3 (5&#x2019;TGCTACACCTCTGCTGGTTGA) and NH3-RT4 (5&#x2019;GACCAGCAAACTCTTGAGTTGAG). PR1a RT&#x2013;PCR used primers PR1a-C1 (5&#x2019;CGTCTTCATCACCTGCAACT) and PR1a-C2 (5&#x2019;TGTCCATACATGCATAAACACG). WRKY45 RT&#x2013;PCR used primers WK45-Q1 (5&#x2019;GGACCAGGGCGATGTCACGT) and WK45-Q2 (5&#x2019;TGTCCATCCATGATTCTTCGGTGA).
