Data were collected at Kingman Reef National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) (6.4 &#xB0; N, 162.4 &#xB0; W) in 2005 () and 2007 and at Palmyra Atoll NWR (5.9 &#xB0; N, 162.1 &#xB0; W) in 2010. Kingman and Palmyra are approximately 60 km apart and are the two northernmost reefs in the Line Islands chain (). Kingman, lacking emergent vegetated dry land, is an atoll reef, whereas Palmyra supports numerous vegetated islets and is a true atoll (hereafter, both are called atolls) (). The reefs of Kingman and Palmyra cover approximately 48 km and 52 km, respectively (depth range = 30 m to shoreline). Neither Kingman nor Palmyra has ever had a permanent resident human population. During WWII-era temporary occupation by the US Navy on Palmyra several alterations were made, including lagoon dredging and causeway construction that altered water flow in and out of the lagoon and shifted patterns of coastal erosion and sedimentation (). Palmyra&#x2019;s lagoon is now heavily degraded, characterized by high turbidity, sedimentation, and a benthos dominated by sponges, not corals () (). Present-day direct human impacts at Palmyra are minimal to non-existent; only a small team of scientific researchers and staff (4&#x2013;20 people) are resident at the on-island research station.Location of Kingman Reef and Palmyra Atoll, northern Line Islands (A) and the distribution of survey sites at Kingman in 2007 (B) and at Palmyra in 2010 (C). 05; indicate sites at Kingman surveyed in 2005. Numbers in parentheses refer to the depths (m) surveyed within each reef habitat.Study sites were chosen using a stratified random design within each of the major reef habitats found at Kingman and Palmyra (). Although reef flats are present on both atolls, their shallow and exposed nature made surveying them unsafe, thus no sampling occurred here. To test the effect of habitat on benthic community patterns (while keeping depth constant), surveys were conducted at 10 m depths across all three reef habitats found at Kingman (patch reef, backreef, and forereef). Reef habitats at Palmyra varied greatly in their depth ranges, confounding any explicit test of habitat. To test the effect of depth (while keeping habitat constant), surveys were conducted at 5, 10 and 20 m on the forereef at both Kingman and Palmyra. We also tested the effect of depth on the reef terrace at Palmyra by surveying at 5 and 20 m; we did not obtain adequate replication at the 10 m depth strata ( = 2) to include this information. Finally, we surveyed a unique shallow (&lt;3 m) backreef habitat in Palmyra&#x2019;s northeast (). Along each transect, percent cover of benthic organisms was calculated using a modification of the photoquadrat method (). At Kingman, two 25 m transects (separated by 10 m) were placed on the benthos at each depth at each site, while at Palmyra a single 50 m transect was used. At Kingman, 10 photoquadrats were captured adjacent to the transect line at fixed intervals, totaling 20 photoquadrats per site. At Palmyra, the number varied spatially but generally equaled 10&#x2013;20 photoquadrats at fixed intervals along each transect (). Each photograph captured an area of 0.54 m in 2005 and 0.63 m in 2007 and 2010. Image analysis was completed using Photogrid 1.0. One hundred points were placed over each photograph in a stratified random design. Organisms under each point were identified to the genus level, with some categories later combined in order to standardize suspected variations in taxonomic identification (e.g., the zooxanthellate soft corals , , and  were combined into &#x201C;leather coral&#x201D;). Turf algae (including the &#x201C;epilithic algal matrix&#x201D;) were defined as a mixed community of filamentous algae and cyanobacteria generally less than 2 cm tall. Crustose coralline algae (CCA; multiple genera) were identified to functional group. Calcified macroalgae were separated from fleshy macroalgae by the presence of calcium carbonate (CaCO); all taxa that contained CaCO were considered calcified (these were principally species of  and ). All benthic organisms that produce calcium carbonate were combined to define total calcified cover. Raw percent cover data for all habitats and depth strata are reported in .We consider the effects of wave energy by comparing spatial patterns of benthic communities across horizontal gradients in wave power, calculated as:  where &#x3C1; is the density of seawater (1024 kg m),  is the acceleration of gravity (9.8 m s),  is mean significant wave height (m), and  is the dominant wave period(s). To quantify wave energy (kW/m), we used NOAA&#x2019;s Wave Watch III (WWIII; ); a global, full-spectral wave model. A 1&#xB0; spatial resolution, 3 h output of mean significant wave height (average of 1/3 largest wave heights), dominant period (time between two consecutive wave crests or troughs), and direction (; degrees north from which the waves are traveling) from January 1997 &#x2013; March 2010 was used. Kingman and Palmyra were divided into 16 discrete 22.5&#xB0; sectors (each 90&#xB0; segment subdivided into four). Long-term climatological means in wave energy were calculated by averaging all 3 h time steps over the entire time series for each sector. Because wave energy standard deviation was highly correlated with the mean ( = 93.3%), it was not included as an independent predictor in the analyses. The WWIII model output reflects deep-water wave energy, not a direct measurement of wave stress across different habitats and depths. Because previous research has shown a strong linear relationship between deep-water offshore waves and wave-induced currents on reef-ecosystems (), this method is a good first-order approximation of wave forcing on coral reefs. To test for horizontal changes in wave energy, not changes as a direct result of changes in depth or habitat type, we limit comparisons of wave energy to forereef benthic communities at 10 m.Patterns of benthic communities were investigated at three taxonomic resolutions: (1) percent cover of calcified versus non-calcified (fleshy) organisms, (2) percent cover of major functional groups (hard coral, soft coral, CCA, other calcified macroalgae, fleshy macroalgae, other), and (3) percent cover of genera. All analyses were performed using R 2.15.1 (R Development Core Team, ) unless otherwise stated. We used a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) () using the  function (vegan package) to test the effect of reef habitat and depth, and all subsequent pairwise comparisons within each factor. Results of each PERMANOVA were visualized with a canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) based on a discriminant analysis () using the  function (BiodiversityR package). Individual variables that might be responsible for any group differences in the CAP analysis were investigated by calculating Spearman&#x2019;s Rank correlations of the canonical ordination axes with the original variables. Variables with strong correlations (in this study, &#x2265;0.4) were identified as &#x201C;indicator genera&#x201D; (i.e., driving group separation in multivariate space). Indicator genera need not be the most dominant (i.e. the organisms with the highest overall percent cover), but instead are those organisms contributing most to within-group similarity, while simultaneously contributing most to between-group dissimilarity. We provide the &#x201C;allocation success&#x201D; results for each CAP analysis in . Allocation success (expressed as a percentage) gives a measure of how distinct a group is relative to all other groups (with group defined as a level within a factor; e.g., the level  within the factor ). Allocation success indicated a more distinct group than expected by chance alone when values exceeded 100/, with  being the number of  defined groups. All PERMANOVA and CAP analyses were based on 10&#x2009;000 random permutations of the raw data.To quantify the proportion of variation in benthic communities explained by horizontal gradients in wave energy, we used a permutational distance-based multivariate linear model () using the Fortran program DisTLM_ (). To better explore the relationships between benthic communities and wave energy on the forereef at each atoll, we calculated univariate regression models for major functional groups and individual indicator genera that dominated the benthos. These univariate models should be considered more like data exploration, unlike the formal hypothesis testing of the multivariate analyses.Finally, the spatial clustering of benthic taxa was calculated using dispersion-based weighting (), which measures deviations of the response variable (e.g., hard coral cover) from a generalized Poisson distribution using a test by permutation (1000 random permutations of the raw data). This approach is robust to flexible rules of clustering behaviour, as may be exhibited by hard coral communities, and for data not displaying a normal distribution, such as the percent cover data used in this study (). The clustering measure is given by the D statistic (variance to mean ratio), with higher values representing higher levels of spatial clustering (). Values of D were determined at the site level, with individual quadrats within any given site acting as the units of replication.
