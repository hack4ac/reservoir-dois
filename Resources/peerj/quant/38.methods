The Macquarie University Human Research Ethics Committee approved the methods used to test participants (Ethics Ref: 5201200658). All participants gave written informed consent to be involved in the research. Twenty-one typical adults (12 female and 9 male) were involved in this study. The mean age of the participants was 31&#xA0;years (SD = 5.3&#xA0;years). Individuals had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no history of auditory-related problems.Stimuli were delivered to participants binaurally at a comfortable listening volume through Phillips SHS4700/37 ear-clip headphones fixed to the gaming EEG system headset (see  for a diagram), using Presentation (version 16; Neurobehavioral System Inc.). There were two blocks of stimuli. Both blocks comprised 566 standard tones (175-ms 1000-Hz pure tones with a 10-ms rise and fall time; 85% of trials) and 100 deviant tones (175-ms 1200-Hz pure tones with a 10-ms rise and fall time; 15% of trials). After 3 standard tones (i.e.,&#xA0;first 3 trials), the presentation of the deviant tones was randomly separated by 3&#x2013;35 standard tones. The stimuli were separated by a jittered stimulus-onset synchrony (SOA) of 0.9&#x2013;1.1 s to minimize the ERP related to the anticipation of a stimulus.The first block of stimuli was presented in a &#x201C;passive condition&#x201D;, in which participants were instructed to watch a silent video and ignore the tones coming through the ear-clips. The second block of stimuli was presented in an &#x201C;active condition&#x201D;, in which participants were asked to count the deviant (higher) tones whilst watching the silent video. They were told that they would be asked to report the total number of deviant tones at the end of the session.The Neuroscan system (version 4.3, hereafter referred to as the research EEG system) was connected to an EEG electrode cap that comprised 16 sintered Ag&#x2013;AgCl electrodes that were sewn into a material cap according to the International 10&#x2013;20 system (Easy Cap). We recorded EEGs from 16 sites: F3, F7, FC4, FT7, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FT8, FC4, F8, F4, M1, and M2. The left mastoid (M1) served as online reference, which left us with 15 electrode sites (i.e.,&#xA0;EEG channels). Vertical eye movements (VEOG) were measured with electrodes placed above and below the left eye. Horizontal eye movements (HEOG) were recorded using electrodes placed on the outer canthi of each eye. The ground electrode was positioned between FPz and Fz. The online EEG was sampled at 1000&#xA0;Hz with an online bandpass filter from 1 to 100&#xA0;Hz. During offline processing, the research EEG system data was downsampled (using EEGLAB; ) to 128&#xA0;Hz to make it compatible with the gaming EEG system sample rate. The onset of each stimulus was marked in the EEG using parallel port pulses.The gaming EEG system (i.e.,&#xA0;Emotiv EPOC) used gold-plated contact-sensors that were fixed to flexible plastic arms of a wireless headset (see ). The headset included 16 sites, aligned with the 10&#x2013;20 system: AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, FC4, M1, and M2. One mastoid (M1) sensor acted as a ground reference point to which the voltage of all other sensors was compared. The other mastoid (M2) was a feed-forward reference that reduced external electrical interference. The signals from the other 14 scalp sites (channels) were high-pass filtered with a 0.16&#xA0;Hz cut-off, pre-amplified and low-pass filtered at an 83&#xA0;Hz cut-off. The analogue signals were then digitised at 2048&#xA0;Hz. The digitised signal was filtered using a 5th-order sinc notch filter (50&#x2013;60&#xA0;Hz), low-pass filtered and down-sampled to 128&#xA0;Hz (specifications taken from the gaming EEG system web forum). The effective bandwidth was 0.16&#x2013;43&#xA0;Hz.Because the gaming EEG system was developed for measuring EEG and not ERPs, it had to be modified to send markers to the EEG to indicate the onset of each stimulus. This was done using a custom-made transmitter module (see below for a description) that converted each tone presented by Presentation into a positive and negative electrical signal. These signals were injected into the O1 and O2 channels of the gaming EEG system headset. The resulting positive and negative spikes recorded in the O1 and O2 EEGs were processed offline in Matlab. A between-channels difference greater than 50&#xA0;mV was coded as a stimulus onset or offset. The event marker was set at a&#xA0;constant time interval&#xA0;(5&#xA0;ms delay of the transmitter module) prior to the point of positive and negative signal cross-over. For around 10% of subjects, there were more stimulus markers automatically identified than expected, which was due to participant movement. These markers were removed manually. The valid stimulus markers were recombined with the EEG data. The &#x201C;sacrifice&#x201D; of the O1 and O2 sites for the purposes of stimulus marking left us with 12 gaming EEG system scalp electrode sites.The custom-made transmitter module consists of two parts: audio tone detector and pulse generator. The audio tone detector is connected to the headphone output of the Presentation computer. Upon detecting an audio tone, it activates the pulse generator. The pulse generator in turn generates a pulse to O1 while O2 is treated as the isolated ground. The amplitude of the pulse is adjustable from 30 to 300&#xA0;&#xB5;V. The pulse duration is fixed at 35 ms. The pulse generator is electrically isolated from the audio tone detector by using an opto-coupler. This ensures that the subject is electrically isolated from any equipment connected to the mains, which is the Presentation computer in this case.Each participant was seated in a comfortable chair 1.5 m away from a 13-inch laptop screen. The experimenter combed the participants on the left, mid-line, and right sides of their scalp firmly in order to reduce electrode impedances (). After the relevant areas on the face and mastoids had been cleaned, the Easy Cap (connected to the research EEG system) was positioned on the participant&#x2019;s head. A blunt metal tube mounted in a syringe was then used to inject conductive gel into the small gap that separated each electrode from the participant&#x2019;s scalp. The blunt tube was circled and gently rocked back and forth against the scalp 3 to 4 times before injecting the gel. This took around 30&#x2013;45&#xA0;min depending on the participant&#x2019;s scalp conductivity.Once all scalp electrodes had been filled with gel, the impedances of each electrode were measured using Neuroscan Synamps acquisition system and the Scan software (Scan 4.3). Further adjustments were made to each electrode until the impedance for all electrodes was less than 5&#xA0;k&#x3A9;. The gaming EEG system headset was then fitted on top of Easy Cap. The gaming EEG system sensors were placed on the head through custom slits made in the Easy Cap (see ). The custom slits were made by fitting the gaming EEG system headset over the Easy Cap and making incisions where the gaming EEG system sensors fell. Where the system positions overlapped, slits were made directly adjacent to the Easy Cap electrode location. The sensors were adjusted until suitable connectivity was achieved as indicated by the TestBench software, which adds a small modulation to the feedforward signal, and measures the size of the signal back from each channel. This procedure took 10&#x2013;15 min.The research and gaming systems recorded EEG simultaneously, as opposed to recording with one system and then the other in a counterbalanced fashion, to maximise the conditions for validation. Specifically, if separate recordings were made and differences were noted, it would be difficult to determine if these were due to differences between the systems, or due to differences between the state of the brain at different points in time (e.g.,&#xA0;differences in level of fatigue, or differences in the amount of exposure to the stimuli).The research and gaming system EEGs were processed offline using EEGLAB version 11.0.4.3b (). Major artifacts were first excluded by eye, and then the EEG in each channel was bandpass filtered from 0.1 to 30&#xA0;Hz. Eye-movements and heartbeat signals (heartbeat signals were present in the research system EEG for just 5 subjects) were removed using independent components analysis (ICA) in EEGLAB (&#x2018;eeg_runica&#x2019; function). The cleaned EEG signals in each channel were then cut into epochs that started &#x2212;102 ms before the onset of each stimulus (0 ms), and ended 500 ms after the onset of the same stimulus. Each epoch was baseline corrected from &#x2212;102 to 0 ms. Epochs with amplitude values &#xB1;150&#xA0;&#xB5;V were excluded. The median number of accepted epochs in the research and gaming EEG system waveforms is shown in .Accepted epochs were averaged together to create a standard late ERP waveform and a deviant late ERP waveform (see ) for both active and passive conditions at each scalp site for each participant. The standard late ERP waveforms in both active and passive conditions were used to measure the P1, N1, P2, and N2 peaks (deviant late ERP waveforms were not used because these comprised fewer epochs, and hence were less reliable than standard ERP waveforms). The deviant late ERP waveform in the active condition was used to represent the P1, N1, P2, and N2 peaks as well as the P3 ERP peak since the P3 is enhanced by active attention to a rare or unexpected event. Note that we define ERP peaks and components in line with . That is, P1, N1, P2, N2, and P3 ERPs are peaks, and the MMN is a component.The late auditory ERP waveforms in the passive condition were used to create one MMN waveform per person. We did this by subtracting the standard late auditory ERP waveform from the deviant late auditory ERP waveform (see ). Data from the passive condition was used because directing attention away from the experimental stimuli (i.e.,&#xA0;towards a movie) minimises the impact of confounding attention-related P3a and P3b ERPs on the MMN (; ).The P1, N1, P2, and N2 ERP peaks were represented by the first two clear positive peaks (P1 and P2), and the first two clear negative peaks (N1 and N2) in the passive and active standard late auditory ERP waveforms (see ). For all subjects, P1 fell between 15 and 120&#xA0;ms; N1 fell between 60 and 180&#xA0;ms; P2 fell between 100 and 420&#xA0;ms; and N2 fell between 170 and 490&#xA0;ms. The amplitude and latency of each peak for each participant was measured via manual selection of the peaks using the EEGLAB software. Manual selection was used for all peaks because automated peak classification incorrectly classified peaks in a minority of individuals due to variation in individuals&#x2019; waveforms. For example, the waveforms of a few participants had a noisy baseline that resulted in incorrect detection of P1. In this early stage of research on gaming EEG systems, we felt it wise to err on the side of caution, and thus manually measured peaks for each participant individually to ensure that all latency and amplitude estimates were truly valid.The P3 ERP was represented by the third positive peak in the deviant late auditory ERP waveform in the active condition (see ). The amplitude and latency of the P3 peak for each participant was measured via manual selection of the peak using the EEGLAB software. For all subjects, this interval fell between 210 and 420 ms.The MMN was represented by the large negative deflection in the passive MMN waveform. It was estimated as the minimum voltage (i.e.,&#xA0;a negative peak) in the interval across which the MMN waveform fell below 0 (i.e.,&#xA0;when the MMN was present). For all subjects, this interval fell between 80 and 250 ms. However, it is noteworthy that the research and gaming EEG system MMN could not be calculated for two participants, and the gaming EEG system MMN could not be calculated for an additional eight participants. In these cases, the deviant late ERP waveform was unexpectedly (and in some cases, drastically) more positive than the standard late auditory ERP waveform.
