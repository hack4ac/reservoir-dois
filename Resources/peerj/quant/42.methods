Six hundred undergraduate students completed the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) (). Of these, 17 (10 female) scored &#x223C;14 (range 11-19, mild mood disturbance) and agreed to take part in the study. An age- and gender-matched control group of 17 students (10 female) with low scores (no mood disturbance) was recruited to ensure matching of demographic variables (see ).The BDI-II is a 21-item mood scale designed to measure depressive symptoms, with each item scored on a four-point scale. No participants scoring above BDI-II Major Depressive Disorder cut-off (&#xA0;&#x2265;&#xA0;20) were included. Participants also completed the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE) (), a self-report instrument on psychotic symptoms administered as part of a parallel study on emotional processing in psychosis proneness. In the present study, we used the CAPE to examine the effect of psychosis proneness as a possible confounding variable. Subjects were screened for exclusion criteria by experienced raters using a self-report checklist for healthy participants, comprising (i) no personal history of neurological or psychiatric illness, (ii)&#xA0;no family history of psychotic or neurological illness in first-degree relatives, (iii) no use of illicit substances, and (iv) no changes in overall level of functioning over the past 6 months. After subjects were given a complete explanation of the study, written informed consent was obtained from all of them. Participants were paid for their participation. The study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen, and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
