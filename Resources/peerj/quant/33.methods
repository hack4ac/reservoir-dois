Experiments were performed at Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre (BMSC) over several summers (July&#x2013;August) on 56 male spiny dogfish sharks (; 0.3&#x2013;1.7&#xA0;kg) collected locally from Barkely Sound by trawling. Only males were used for purposes of population conservation, as females were invariably pregnant. [Note that  have recently proposed that these north-east Pacific elasmobranchs are a separate species () distinct from ]. The fish were held in a large 151,000-L tank at seasonal photoperiod, served with running seawater at the experimental temperature (12&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;1&#xA0;&#xB0;C), salinity (30&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;2 ppt) and pH (7.95&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;0.10) for 2&#x2013;8 weeks prior to experimentation. During this period they were fed every 3&#x2013;4 days with a 3% ration of dead hake (), but removed to smaller 1000-L tanks for 1&#x2013;2 weeks fasting prior to experimentation, under the same conditions. Gill tissue and plasma samples were taken from 9 of the animals sacrificed for other studies, in order to provide  reference values; the remainder were used for  perfused head preparations. The  samples were taken from deeply anaesthetized animals, as described below for the perfused head preparations. All procedures followed Canada Council for Animal Care guidelines and were approved by BMSC and McMaster University Animal Care Committees (Animal Ethics Research Board of McMaster University AUP # 09004-10).Methods followed those developed by , with minor modifications. Before surgery, the fish were injected with 5000 i.u. sodium heparin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) via the caudal vein and left for 15&#x2013;20 min. The fish was then deeply anaesthetized in MS-222 (0.2&#xA0;g&#x2009;L; Syndel Laboratories, Qualicum Beach, BC, Canada) and decapitated posterior to the pectoral fins. The brain was pithed via the spinal cord. The ventral aorta was cannulated with Clay-Adams PE-160 tubing (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and the dorsal aorta with PE60 or PE160 depending on fish size; both ventral and dorsal aortic catheters were filled with the appropriate saline (see below). A thin latex rubber sheet (dental dam) placed anterior to the pectoral fins was then used to seal the head into a 1.8 L-external reservoir made from a plastic bottle, and internal perfusion and external irrigation were commenced immediately (time&#xA0;=&#xA0;0&#xA0;min).The external reservoir was filled with approximately 1.0 L of sea water which was continuously gassed with  and recirculated via an external submersible pump (Little Giant, Oklahoma City, OK, USA) connected to the bottom of the reservoir. The pump, controlled by a rheostat, was set to irrigate the gills at a rate of 2.5&#xA0;L&#x2009;min via soft silastic tubing (0.5&#xA0;cm i.d.) inserted via a Y-tube into both spiracles. A Model 1100 cardiac pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA) set to a working mode of 1/3 systole, 2/3 diastole and a heart rate of  was employed for perfusion via the ventral aortic catheter with the appropriate saline which had been pre-gassed as described below. The stroke volume was adjusted for each preparation so as to create a perfusion rate of 20&#xA0;ml&#x2009;min&#xA0;kg whole body. The output of the cardiac pump passed first through an inverted 25-ml Erlenmeyer flask containing a 5-ml air&#x2013;space which served as a &#x201C;&#x201D; to reduce pulsatility and to trap inadvertent bubbles, and then past a T-junction connected to a P23BB pressure transducer (Statham Instruments, Oxnard, CA, USA) linked to a Harvard amplifier-oscillograph system so as to continuously monitor the input perfusion pressure to the ventral aorta. The T-junction also served as a sampling point for ventral aortic perfusate. The external reservoir pump and the perfusion reservoir were both immersed in flowing seawater baths so as to maintain 12&#xA0;&#xB0;C. Only one saline treatment was used for each preparation, for a 45 min perfusion period.Samples of external water (10 ml), inflowing ventral aortic perfusate (0.1 ml) from the T-junction, and outflowing perfusate (0.1 ml) directly from the dorsal aortic catheter, were taken at 5 min intervals from time 0 to 45&#xA0;min. These samples were then aliquotted immediately for radioactivity measurements and frozen for later measurements of urea. At the end of 45 min, perfusion and irrigation were stopped, the head was removed, and the exact water volume of the external reservoir was measured. The pressure drop across the catheter at the same cardiac pump output was measured at the T-junction so as to calculate the true ventral aortic input pressure. The gills were removed by dissection, blotted dry, and the soft tissue of the gill epithelium was sampled by gently scraping the surface with a glass slide. Three samples of approximately 0.5 g were immediately added to tared tubes containing 1 ml of ice-cold 8% . The tubes were reweighed to determine the exact weight of gill tissue, then allowed to sit on ice for 3&#xA0;h with intermittent vortexing. Thereafter the tubes were centrifuged at 13,000G for 2&#xA0;min and the supernatant aliquotted for radioactivity measurements and frozen for later measurements of urea. Additionally two gill tissue samples of approximately 0.3 g were weighed out into aluminum dishes for determination of water content.The basic saline (Control saline 1) contained 350&#xA0;mmol&#xA0;L urea and was identical to that used by  &#x2013; see  in that paper &#x2013; except that the trimethyl amine oxide (TMAO) concentration was set to 85&#xA0;mmol&#xA0;L rather than 15&#xA0;mmol&#xA0;L to better represent  values (; ; ). All other salines were modifications of this. In Control saline 2, urea concentration was reduced to 175&#xA0;mmol&#xA0;L, with osmotic balance achieved by addition of 175&#xA0;mmol&#xA0;L mannitol. For treatments with the urea analogues thiourea or acetamide, the saline contained 175&#xA0;mmol&#xA0;L urea and 175&#xA0;mmol&#xA0;L of the respective analogue. All salines were filtered through a  Millipore filter prior to use, and were equilibrated with a precision gas mixture of 0.25%  in air to yield a  of about 1.9&#xA0;mm Hg. The pH was set to 7.7&#x2013;7.8. Diffusion of the gas through silastic tubing rather than direct bubbling was employed to avoid foaming of the bovine serum albumen component.The water content of gill tissue and its distribution.
                
              Means&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;1SEM (N). Means not sharing the same letters are significantly different (&#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;0.05). ECFV and ICFV were measured only for the Control Saline 2 treatment.In all of the experiments, urea efflux was calculated from the appearance of &#x201C;cold&#x201D; urea in the external seawater, as measured by chemical assay. The same assay was used to measure urea concentration in the gill tissue. However there is no assay of comparable sensitivity for the urea analogues. Therefore in order to evaluate whether radiotracer methodology would be suitable, in 6 preparations perfused with Control saline 1, []urea (Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK; ) was added to the perfusion medium at a concentration of  to allow simultaneous measurements by both &#x201C;hot&#x201D; and &#x201C;cold&#x201D; techniques. Based on these results, [C]thiourea (; Sigma-Aldrich; 30&#x2013;60&#xA0;mCi&#xA0;mmol) and [C]acetamide (; NEN-Dupont, 58&#xA0;mCi&#xA0;mmol) were added to the perfusion saline in the respective analogue trials. In order to measure extracellular and intracellular spaces,  of the extracellular space marker [H]methoxy inulin (Perkin-Elmer, Woodbridge, ON, Canada; 2500&#xA0;mCi&#xA0;mmol) was added to the saline in 5 preparations perfused with Control saline 2. This added a negligible amount of &#x201C;cold&#x201D; methoxy inulin (&#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;10&#xA0;mmol&#xA0;L) to the perfusate.Urea in sea water, perfusate, and gill extract samples was measured by the colorimetric diacetyl monoxime assay of . All radioactivity measurements were made on a LS6500 scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). Water samples (5&#xA0;ml) for determination of [C]urea, [C]thiourea, or [C]acetamide radioactivity were added to 10&#xA0;ml of Aqueous Counting Scintillant (ACS) (Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK). Perfusate samples () and gill extract samples () were diluted to 5&#xA0;ml with sea water and similarly added to 10&#xA0;ml ACS. Quench correction was performed by an onboard program using the external standard (Beckman H-# system) and checked by internal standardization. For determination of [H]methoxy inulin radioactivity, 0.8&#xA0;ml of gill extract and 1.0&#xA0;ml of perfusate were diluted to 2&#xA0;ml with seawater and added to 4&#xA0;ml of ACS. The quench in each sample was corrected by internal standardization. Water content of gill samples was determined gravimetrically by drying at 60&#xA0;&#xB0;C for three days.Mean urea efflux rates were calculated from the slopes of the appearance curves of urea in the external sea water, factored by time, total fish body weight, and the measured volume of the external reservoir. In the case of radiolabeled compounds ([C]urea, [C]thiourea, and [C]acetamide), the slope of the appearance curve of radioactivity (dpm&#xA0;h) was additionally factored by the mean specific activity (i.e.&#xA0;) of venous (i.e.&#xA0;input) perfusate samples over the same period. Measurements of gill tissue concentrations of urea, thiourea, and acetamide by [C] radioactivity were based on the radioactivity of gill extracts (after correction for dilution), factored by the mean specific activity (i.e.&#xA0;) of venous and arterial perfusate samples taken at the end of the perfusion period. Concentrations were expressed both per kg tissue and per kg tissue water, as noted in figures.The extracellular fluid volume of gill tissue was calculated as:  where the numerator was based on radioactivity measurements in gill extracts, corrected for dilution, and denominator was the mean of arterial and venous radioactivity measurements at the end of the perfusion period. Intracellular fluid volume (ICFV) was calculated as the difference between total tissue water (kg ) and ECFV (kg ).Data have been expressed as means&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;1 SEM, where &#xA0;=&#xA0;number&#xA0;of&#xA0;animals. Data were checked for normality and homogeneity of variance, and in a few cases log or arc-sine transformed to achieve this. Means were compared by Student&#x2019;s paired or unpaired Student&#x2019;s t-test (two-tailed) as appropriate, or in the case of multiple comparisons, by 1-way ANOVA followed by the Fisher&#x2019;s LSD test. Regression lines were fitted by least squares, and the significance of Pearson&#x2019;s correlation coefficient () assessed. A significance level of &#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;0.05 was used throughout.
