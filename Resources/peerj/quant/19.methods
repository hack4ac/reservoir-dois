Seven naive subjects participated in the experiment. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and were paid $15 dollars for a single experimental session. The experiment was carried out under the guidelines of the Barrow Neurological Institute&#x2019;s Internal Review Board (protocol 04BN039), and written informed consent was obtained from each participant.During the experiment, subjects rested their head on a chin/forehead-rest 57&#xA0;cm away from a video monitor (Barco Reference Calibrator V), while free viewing the video clips. Their eye movements were non-invasively recorded with a video-based eye tracker (Eyelink 1000, SR Research), at 500 samples per second. From the eye tracker recordings, we identified and removed blink periods as the portions of the recorded data where the pupil information was missing. Furthermore, we removed the 200&#xA0;ms before and after each identified blink period, to eliminate periods of time in which the pupil is partially occluded.We identified saccades using an objective algorithm (). To reduce spurious positives due to noise, we analyzed only binocular saccades (i.e.&#xA0;saccades with at least one sample of overlap in both eyes). Furthermore, we ensured that overshoot corrections were not counted as saccades by imposing a minimum intersaccadic interval of 20&#xA0;ms ().Subjects sat in a dark, quiet room and watched video clips of 10 to 12&#xA0;s each, in which Teller performed different variations of a &#x201C;Cups and balls&#x201D; magic routine. The videos had a resolution of 720&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;480 pixels and subtended an area of 28&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;19 degrees of visual angle inside the visual field. The average luminance of the clips was 23&#xA0;cd/m, and their contrast ratio () was 128:1. Areas of the screen not occupied by the video were white.In each clip, Teller performed the manipulation sequentially in each of three different cups, located from left to right on the screen. The manipulation in the first two cups was identical in all the clips (&#x201C;Standard&#x201D; load, see below), whereas the routine used in the third cup varied in each video clip (). After the third cup&#x2019;s sleight was complete, Teller individually lifted all three cups to show the balls hidden underneath them. Subjects were instructed to report, as fast as possible, the removal and placing of each ball as soon as they were aware of them, by pressing one of two different buttons on a gamepad with their left and right index fingers (button &#x201C;1&#x201D; for removals, button &#x201C;2&#x201D; for placings, see ). A removal was defined as the moment each ball stopped touching either the table or a cup, and a placing was defined as when each ball made physical contact with a cup or the table.In &#x201C;Standard&#x201D;, the routine performed on the third cup was identical to that performed for the previous two cups. In &#x201C;No ball&#x201D;, the routine was again the same as in the first two cups, but there was no ball initially placed on top of the cup. In &#x201C;Lift&#x201D;, the ball initially on top of the third cup was lifted to approximately eye level before the cup was loaded. In &#x201C;Table&#x201D;, the ball originally on top of the third cup was placed on the table before the cup was loaded. In &#x201C;Drop&#x201D;, the ball was dropped out of the screen before the third cup was loaded. In &#x201C;Stuck&#x201D;, the ball was attached to the top of the third cup.

The spikes in the time courses represent actual (dashed lines) and reported (solid lines) loads and removals. Blue symbolizes removals and red placings.The different routines tested were: Standard (): the standard maneuver, identical to the one performed in the first two cups.No ball (): similar to the &#x201C;Standard&#x201D; routine, but there was no ball on top of the third cup.Lift (): the ball on top of the third cup was lifted to eye level before loading the cup.Table (): the top ball on the third cup was placed on the table before the cup was loaded.Drop (): the top ball on the third cup was dropped to the floor before the cup was loaded.Stuck (): similar to the &#x201C;Drop&#x201D; condition, but the ball was stuck to the cup and therefore it did not fall.
            For each of these different routines, we tested other variables concerning the magician&#x2019;s performance. We tested &#x201C;Clear cups&#x201D;, in which the cups were transparent, versus &#x201C;Opaque cups&#x201D;, in which they were not. We also tested &#x201C;Load&#x201D; versus &#x201C;No load&#x201D; conditions, in which the third cup was either &#x201C;loaded&#x201D; (i.e.&#xA0;a ball was surreptitiously placed under it), or not. Finally, we compared a &#x201C;No face&#x201D; condition, in which the magician&#x2019;s face was occluded by a static black rectangle, versus the unmodified &#x201C;Face&#x201D;-visible video clips. This yielded a total of 48 conditions. Each subject saw each condition twice. The order of conditions was blocked and randomized for each subject. Each participant saw all the 48 conditions first in random order, and then the same conditions again in a new random sequence.We defined a correct report of ball placing or removal as an appropriate button press in the 2000 ms immediately following the first movie frame in which the ball had been placed or removed. We also coded correct reports when subject did not indicate a placing after the magician performed a faked load. The reaction time of each report was measured in the conditions in which the cup was loaded. For each placing, gaze distance was calculated as the average distance between the subjects&#x2019; gaze and the point where the cup sat on the table, during the 400&#xA0;ms immediately subsequent to, and following, the first movie frame in which the load occurred (or the equivalent frame in the &#x201C;No load&#x201D; condition). We varied the duration of these two time windows and found that the results were similar. Subjects were allowed to report ball placings during the reveal sequence at the end of each trial, in which the magician lifted the cups to show their contents. We counted the number of reports the subjects made during this period in each trial and considered them &#x201C;late findings&#x201D;.Statistical testing employed a logistic regression fit to correct reports of placings and removals, and a linear regression fit to the reaction times and the gaze distances. The different magic routines, the load or no load of the third cup, the visibility or occlusion of the face, and the use of clear or opaque cups were factors in the main analyses. The analyses to determine the evolution of responses and gaze positions throughout the experiment used only the trial number as predictor. The statistical models determined main effects and first order interactions, when applicable. Only significant effects are reported in the text. Pairwise comparisons across different routines were tested with the Newman&#x2013;Keuls  test.
