Sampling was conducted in 2010&#x2013;2011 at five sites known to harbor dusky salamanders (): two seepage areas in Highbridge Park, Manhattan, NYC; streams in Corson&#x2019;s Brook Woods and Reed&#x2019;s Basket Willow Swamp Park in Staten Island, NYC; and a stream in the Watchung Reservation, Union Co., NJ, approximately 48 km west of NYC. These sites were sampled because they were the only sites known to contain  in NYC or adjacent suburban counties, and the NYC sites are managed by the NYC Department of Parks &amp; Recreation as &#x201C;Forever Wild&#x201D; conservation areas. The Highbridge Park sites were rediscovered by one of the authors (EP) in 2005 based on a note in the herpetological literature (). These two seeps are isolated from each other by the Washington and Hamilton Bridges (erected in 1888 and 1963, respectively) that cumulatively carry fourteen lanes of automobile traffic. The Staten Island sites are part of the Greenbelt, a contiguous series of protected areas totaling 1,100 ha composed of swamps and secondary forests. The Watchung Reservation in NJ is a 790 ha protected area composed of primary forest and recreational areas in a valley of the Watchung mountains, and is surrounded by low- to medium-density suburban housing. We also searched for but were unable to locate  at other locations where they have been reported in recent decades, including the Lost Brook Preserve in the Palisades, NJ, and two sites in Westchester Co., NY: Hilltop Hanover Farms and Ward Pound Ridge Reservation. We initially also failed to sample  from the Great Swamp at the Greenbelt Nature Center, Staten Island, NY, but did find a few individuals after the sampling and lab work for this study were concluded. These samples and another site recently discovered on Staten Island (Bloodroot Valley) will be included in a future landscape genomics study of urban salamanders (see Discussion).Map of study sites in relation to urbanization in the NYC metropolitan area. Areas colored in shades of red and purple denote landscape areas with increasingly greater percentages of impervious surfaces as measured by the 2006 National Landcover Database ().We captured salamanders by hand or dipnet after turning over cover objects such as logs, rocks, bottles, and metal/plastic sheeting in or near streams. Tail tips were clipped and stored in 80% ethanol until DNA extraction using the standard protocol for the Qiagen DNEasy tissue kit. All animal handling protocols were approved by the Natural Resources Group of the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation, and followed the recommendations of the Declining Amphibian Task Force&#x2019;s &#x201C;Fieldwork Code of Practice&#x201D; () and the NY State Department of Environmental Conservation&#x2019;s &#x201C;Bio-safety Protocols for Reptile and Amphibian Sampling&#x201D;. Five previously described microsatellite loci were PCR-amplified in 15 &#xB5;l volumes using Promega PCR master mix and published thermal cycling profiles. PCR included one primer with a CAG or M13R tail and an associated probe with fluorescent WellRED D2, D3, or D4 dye. The total reaction included 7.5 &#xB5;l master mix, 4.4 &#xB5;l water, 0.8 &#xB5;l of the 10 &#xB5;M untailed primer, and 0.4 &#xB5;l each of the 10 &#xB5;M tailed primer and 10 &#xB5;M fluorescent probe. The amplified loci included Dau3, Dau11, and Dau12 from , Doc03 from , and ENS6 from . PCR fragments were separated and sized on a Beckman Coulter CEQ8000 sequencer. Alleles were scored using automatic binning procedures followed by visual inspection in the Beckman fragment analysis software. The genotypes and spatial coordinates for all study sites are available on the Dryad digital repository ().Each locus was tested for deviations from Hardy&#x2013;Weinberg (HWE) and linkage equilibrium over the total sample of 141 genotypes and within each of the five sampling sites using GENEPOP 4.0 (). We also used MICRO-CHECKER to analyze genotypes within each population for homozygote excess due to null alleles, allelic dropout, or errors in allele calling due to stuttering (). To characterize genetic diversity, we calculated the numbers of alleles, effective alleles, and private alleles at each site, and the observed and expected heterozygosity at each site and for each locus across the entire sample, using GenAlex 6.4 (). We tested for genetic bottlenecks in each population using the authors&#x2019; recommended settings for microsatellites (TPM; 95% single-step mutations) in BOTTLENECK 1.2 ().To examine population differentiation, we calculated pairwise  between all site pairs using 1,000 random permutations in GenAlex to assess significance. We then used the evolutionary clustering method implemented in STRUCTURE 2.3 to place individual genotypes in clusters that minimized deviations from Hardy&#x2013;Weinberg and linkage equilibria (). We did not use the sampling site as prior information, and allowed for correlated allele frequencies and genetic admixture across populations (). We conducted ten replicate runs for each value of  = 1&#x2013;10, with a burn-in of 500,000 followed by 4.5 million iterations. The most likely  was identified using the mean and standard deviation of Pr (|), and the &#x394; method from , as calculated by the STRUCTURE HARVESTER (). We used CLUMPP 1.1 () and DISTRUCT 1.1 () to align and visualize the results of the ten replicates at the most likely value of . We also used the &#x2018;spatial clustering of groups&#x2019; module in BAPS 5.2 to identify the best value of  using predefined sampling sites and spatial coordinates as prior information ().
