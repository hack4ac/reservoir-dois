We used the QIAGEN&#x2013;DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (Qiagen, CA, USA) to obtain genomic DNA from blood samples collected in the field and tissue samples from the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University (Cambridge, MA, USA; Animal protocol number AEP 24-06) following the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol. The list of songbird species investigated is shown in . We initially amplified the entire coding sequence of exon 3 of MHC class I genes and a small part of the flanking intronic regions (see ) in two house finches () and two Eastern Bluebirds () using primers HN34 (5&#x2032;-CCATGGGTCTCTGTGGGTA-3&#x2032;) and HN45 (5&#x2032;-CCATGGAATTCCCACAGGAA-3&#x2032;) from . Although these primers were originally designed for the isolation of MHC class I loci in great reed warblers () they have proven successful in the isolation of MHC class I sequences in other passerine species (e.g., ; ). PCR amplification was carried out using a PTC-100 Programmable Thermal Controller (MJ research, MA, USA) in a final volume of 25 &#xB5;l containing 1 unit of EconoTaq DNA polymerase (Lucigen Corporation, Middleton, WI, USA), 1&#xD7; PCR buffer (Lucigen), 1 mM MgCl, 10 pmoles of each primer, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 10 &#xB5;g of BSA, 5% DMSO, and approximately 10&#x2013;30 ng of DNA. The cycling protocol consisted of an initial denaturation step of 95&#xB0;during 4 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95&#xB0;C for 45 s, 55&#xB0;C for 45 s and 72&#xB0;C for 45 s plus a final extension step of 72&#xB0;C during 4 min. After visualization of PCR products in 1% agarose gels stained with SYBR safe (Invitrogen, CA, USA) we cloned fragments using the StrataClone PCR cloning kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc., CA, USA) and inserts of the expected size (around 350 bp) were re-amplified using M13 primers, purified with ExoSAP-IT reagent (Affymetrix, CA, USA) and sequenced with M13 primers and BigDye 3.1 reagents (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) supplemented with BDX64 buffer (MCLAB, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocols. Sixteen positive clones from each of the two birds were selected for sequencing. Fluorescently labeled fragments were resolved into an Applied Biosystems 3730 xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). The sequences obtained from house finches and Eastern Bluebirds were aligned in BioEdit ver 7.0 () and Geneious R6 (). New degenerate primers sitting on the boundaries of exon 3 were designed following the alignment of house finch and Bluebirds MHC class I sequences. These primers were MhcPasCI-FW 5&#x2032;-CSCSCAGGTCTSCACAC-3&#x2032; and MhcPASCI-RV 5&#x2032;-CWCARKAATTCTGYTCHCACC-3&#x2032; (). Primer MhcPasCI-FW is similar in its sequence to the primers HN36 and HN38 designed by  but our primer is more degenerated and 3 nucleotides shorter in the 3&#x2032; end (the last nine nucleotides of the primer sit into the coding sequence of exon 3). The utility of this primer pair was tested in each of the 16 songbird species from 14 different taxonomic families, as well as two suboscine passerine species, a manakin (Pipiridae) and a New World Flycatcher (Tyrranidae). The PCR protocol used was the same as that described above for the primer pair HN34/HN45. Likewise, PCR products were cloned and sixteen positive bands per species or individual sequenced with M13 primers as described above. Sequences were again edited and aligned in BioEdit and Geneious R6 (). We then searched for different, putative alleles within each individual. Given the low number of clones screened we only considered as different, presumably functional alleles, those DNA sequences differing in at least three nucleotide positions and not showing stop codons or disrupted reading frames. These criteria will minimize the impact of PCR and sequencing artifacts in our allele repertoire but may also underestimate the number of alleles per individual (e.g., when true alleles differed in just one nucleotide positions but they are not found in more than one clone each). All sequences fitting these criteria have been deposited into the GenBank public domain (see results). Putative pseudogenes and those sequences suspected to be mosaic or chimeric sequences were discarded. In a study focused on population genetics, the genotyping of MHC loci across large complex multigene families requires more stringent criteria and protocols to define true alleles than those described in this study (e.g., ; ). Here our purpose was to produce a first glimpse of the utility of our primers and broad macroevolutionary patterns, but future studies using our primers should more thoroughly analyze a MHC variability in particular species with more stringent quality checks.The MHC class I sequences here isolated plus additional exon 3 sequences from non-passerine species downloaded from the public domain (see ) were aligned using the Muscle algorithm () as implemented in TranslatorX, a codon-based alignment algorithm (), using default options. We built a phylogenetic tree using the Neighbour-joining method () as implemented in Geneious R6 () using an optimal substitution model (Tamura-Nei model +gamma  =  0.78 in this case) from ModelTest v. 3.5 (). An MHC class I exon 3 sequence of the Balsas armed lizard (l; GenBank Acc. No. EU839667) was used as outgroup. Branch support was evaluated by 1,000 bootstrap replicates. We verified that the major branches in this tree, including the strongly supported branches leading to the songbird sequences and to several of the major clades of sequences were present when using the maximum likelihood method as implemented in Phyml v. 3.0, using SPR tree searching and an HKY model of substitution with estimated variation in rates among sites (). The phylogenetic relationships among songbird MHC class I sequences were also visualized through a neigbor-net network built in Splitstree 4.0 () according to Kimura-2-parameter distances. We tested for a significant clustering of MHC sequences by species using a permutation test in MacClade in which we compared the observed number of parsimony changes in a character coded as species designation on the best tree with the distribution observed on 1000 random trees. Non-synonymous () and synonymous substitution rates () were calculated in MEGA ver 5.0 () according to the modified Nei-Gojorobi method with Jukes-Cantor correction and 1,000 bootstrap replicates for variance estimation. Two analyses were carried out, one including only putative PBR codons and another including the remaining codons. Codons were labeled as PBR or non-PBR in accordance with previously documented patterns of positive selection across the avian MHC class I (see ; ), which also suggested large overlapping between the PBR of the human MHC class I molecule (; ) and homologous sites in birds. The exon 3 codons classified as PBR-codons were 5, 7, 8, 9, 23, 25, 38, 60, 61, 62, 65, 66, 68 and 73.We carried out an independent analysis of codon substitution using the codeml software in the PAML package v.4.4 (). Specifically we used the branch-site and clade tests (models A, C and D, see ; ), focusing on the branch leading to songbirds (model A), or the entire clade of songbirds (models C and D). These models differ in their structure as well as in the assumptions about the values that specific parameters can take. For example, in model A, the &#x2018;background&#x2019; branch cannot have any sites with values of &#x3C9; greater than 1, and the test focuses on a specific branch, in our case the single branch leading to the passerine sequences. By contrast, in both models C and D, one class of sites (&#x3C9;) is constrained to fall below 1. But other classes of sites (&#x3C9;) are either constrained to equal 1 (model C) or allowed to take on any positive value (model D). Models C and D both test average rates across clades, rather than specific branches, but they differ in the statistical models assumed, with model C employing the more accurate Bayes-Empirical-Bayes (BEB) method, rather than the na&#xEF;ve empirical bayes (NEB) approach (; ). However all of these methods allowed us to assess those PBR codons experiencing adaptive evolution without identifying them a priori.We also noticed pronounced variation in GC content of the avian MHC class I sequences across various groups, particularly in the 3rd position of codons. Given that base compositional variation is a consequence of a variety of molecular forces, such as recombination, gene conversion and selection, this base compositional variation could be important for understanding the evolutionary forces operating on avian MHC class I genes (). To quantify and better understand the dynamics of GC-content in avian MHC class I genes, we analyzed the phylogenetic signal in GC content using a comparative method (see ) that is well suited to testing for the significance of means and variances of continuous characters among clades under a Brownian motion model. Base compositional evolution in DNA sequences has often been challenging to analyze because standard phylogenetics packages that allow this calculation often perform standard, non-phylogenetic tests of significance, which are inappropriate (e.g., PAUP*; ). The likelihood method of  (see also ) is well suited for the analysis of diversification of continuous phenotypic or genotypic traits. This approach is able to distinguish between two possible causes of differences in means between groups: differences in rate of trait evolution (as revealed by the Brownian variance of the trait) between groups without there being differences in means, and true differences in means between groups, with or without differences in rates of evolution. For these calculations we removed the outgroup and used an ultrametricized tree using the penalized likelihood method of , using a value of 2 for the smoothing parameter &#x3BB;. The Brownian motion analysis was implemented in the &#x2018;motmot&#x2019; package in R, version 1.0.1 ().
