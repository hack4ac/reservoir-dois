HF-HeRE is located within the 121-ha Simes Tract (42.47&#xB0;&#x2013;42.48&#xB0;N, 72.22&#xB0;&#x2013;72.21&#xB0;W; elevation 215&#x2013;300 m a.s.l.) at the Harvard Forest Long Term Ecological Research Site in Petersham, Massachusetts, USA (, Fig. 1). As in most New England forests, the Simes Tract as was cleared for agriculture in the early and mid-1800s. Many of the trees that had regenerated following agricultural abandonment in the mid- to late-1800s were blown down in the 1938 Great Hurricane, and analysis of tree-cores from the tract show that the trees in our experimental plots average 55&#x2013;80&#xA0;years old (; AM Ellison, DA Orwig &amp; AA Barker Plotkin, unpublished data), The soils are predominantly coarse-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Dystrudepts in the Charlton Series that are derived from glacial till (). Across the eight HF-HeRE study plots, the soil pH ranges from 3.0&#x2013;3.4 in the organic layer and from 3.5&#x2013;4.0 in the mineral layer, and the soil C:N ratios range from 26&#x2013;33. Much of the central portion of the tract is poorly drained or swampy; elevated areas are better drained.  and  L. (red maple) dominate the poorly drained soils, whereas , along with  L. and  L. (red and white oaks), and  L. (white pine) predominate on hills and slopes.  L. (black birch),  Marsh. (sugar maple), and other hardwoods grow at low frequency and density throughout the tract ().The complete design of HF-HeRE is described by ; only salient details are repeated here. The eight 90&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;90&#xA0;m (0.81 ha) plots comprising this experiment are grouped in two blocks (), each consisting of three plots initially dominated by  and one plot of mixed hardwoods (). The &#x201C;valley&#x201D; block (plots 1&#x2013;3 and 8) is in undulating terrain bordered on its northern edge by a -dominated wetland (permission to work in this wetland and in the adjacent bordering vegetation [&#x201C;buffer zone&#x201D;] was provided by the Petersham, Massachusetts, Conservation Commission). The &#x201C;ridge&#x201D; block (plots 4&#x2013;7) is on a forested ridge. Plots were identified in 2003 and sampled for two growing seasons (spring/summer in each of 2003 and 2004) prior to applying canopy manipulation treatments &#x2013; girdling, or harvesting of standing  along with cutting of merchantable hardwoods and  &#x2013; to one plot in each block.Location of the Harvard Forest Hemlock Removal Experiment in Massachusetts, USA. The regional map shows the basal area of eastern hemlock at a 1&#xA0;km resolution. The inset shows the location of the experimental blocks and treatments. Plots 1, 2, 3, and 8 make up the valley block; plots 4&#x2013;7 make up the ridge block. Each canopy manipulation treatment &#x2013; hemlock control (He), girdled (G), logged (L), and hardwood control (Hw) &#x2013; was applied to a 90&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;90 m plot within each block.Changes in total average basal area (m&#xA0;ha) and density (ha) in the treatment plots of the Harvard Forest Hemlock Removal Experiment.In the girdled treatment plots, the bark and cambium of all individual  trees, saplings, and seedlings were cut through using chain saws or hand knives over a 2-day period in May 2005. Girdled trees died over a 2-year period but were left standing in place to simulate the physical decline and mortality of hemlock resulting from infestation by the hemlock woolly adelgid (). No other species were girdled and there was no site disturbance other than walking between trees.In the logged treatment plots, all  trees &gt;20&#xA0;cm diameter at breast height (DBH, measured 1.3 m above ground) and 50% of the commercially valuable  and  were felled using a chainsaw and removed using a skidder between February and April 2005, when the ground was frozen. Because this logging operation mimicked the effects of an intensive commercial hemlock salvage operation, trees of small size, poor quality, or little economic value, such as  and  were also removed to facilitate log removal or to improve future stand quality, but some good-quality  and  were retained. We recognize that the removal of tree species other than  can have some impacts on changes forest dynamics in the otherwise hemlock-dominated stands. However, in the logged plots,  accounted initially for &gt;50% of the basal area, but made up &gt;80% of both the number of felled trees and their basal area (). Thus, the effects of hemlock loss were likely to dominate observed responses of the forest to this canopy manipulation.Two control plots in each block were not manipulated. In each block, one of each of these control plots was dominated by hemlock, the other by mid-successional hardwoods of the same general age of the remaining forest (55&#x2013;80&#xA0;years). The latter control plots represents the most likely future forest conditions after hemlock has disappeared from the landscape (; ).We measured species richness and cover of understory herbs, and density and cover of tree seedlings and saplings to determine how these attributes of vegetation structure varied among the two canopy manipulation treatments and the two different controls (Prediction 1). In 2003 (prior to canopy manipulations), we established two transects running through the central 30&#xA0;m&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;30&#xA0;m of each plot to quantify understory richness, cover, and density. Five 1- m subplots were spaced evenly along each transect and have been sampled annually since 2003. In each subplot, tree seedlings (&lt;1.3&#xA0;m tall) were counted and percent cover of tree seedlings, herbs, shrubs, ferns, and grasses was estimated to the nearest one percent. Grasses and sedges were identified only to genus as most lacked flowers or fruits necessary for accurate species-level identification. A species list has been compiled annually for the central 30&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;30-m core area of each plot. Nomenclature follows . The number of sapling-sized trees (&gt;1.3&#xA0;m tall but &lt;5&#xA0;cm DBH) was tallied by species in the 30&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;30-m core area of each plot in 2005, 2007 and 2009.In 2003&#x2013;2004, all trees&#xA0;&#x2265;&#xA0;5&#xA0;cm DBH in each plot were tagged with aluminum tags, identified, measured (DBH) and mapped ( coordinates relative to a plot corner) using a compass, auto-level, and stadia rods. Initial basal area was higher in the hemlock plots (45.6&#x2013; 53&#xA0;m&#xA0;ha) than in the hardwood control plots (29.7&#x2013; 35.6&#xA0;m&#xA0;ha) and basal area was slightly higher in the ridge block than in the valley block (species composition data reported in Table 1 of ). Initial stem density ranged from 678&#xA0;stems&#xA0;ha in the ridge hemlock control plot to 1354&#xA0;stems&#xA0;ha in the valley girdled plot.  comprised 50%&#x2013;69% of initial basal area and 55%&#x2013;70% of initial stem density in the six plots initially dominated by this species (hemlock control, logged, and girdled plots). In the hardwood control plots,  comprised &lt;10% of the initial basal area and 10%&#x2013;11% of the initial stem density. Other species that comprised &gt;10% initial basal area in any plot included ,  (hardwood valley plot only), , and . Decline and death of trees in the girdled plots was tracked following treatments; most  had died within 24 months (). In 2009, each tree was assessed for survival and diameter growth (for living stems).Prediction 2 addresses changes in volume of coarse woody debris (CWD) &#x2013; standing dead trees (snags), stumps, and volume of fallen boles and branches &gt;7.5&#xA0;cm in diameter &#x2013; as a function of canopy manipulation treatment. These variables have been surveyed biennially since 2005 (post-treatment only). In summer 2005, just after the girdling and logging were completed, eight transects were established in each plot beginning from each cardinal and ordinal plot corner/edge and extending 35&#x2013;50&#xA0;m towards the plot center. To measure standing dead wood, snags and stumps were sampled along a 4-m wide strip plot that straddles the line transect. Species (or species group) were recorded for each individual stump or snag; its lower diameter was measured, and its top diameter and height either were measured directly or estimated if the snag height exceeded the length of a stadia rod. From these measurements, snag volume was calculated as the frustum of a cone (). Volume of downed wood was estimated using the line-intercept method (). The diameter, decay class (), and species (or species group) of each piece that intersected the line was recorded.Prediction 3 is that primary productivity, soil carbon flux, and soil nutrient cycling and availability should decline slowly in the girdled plots and rapidly in the logged plots. We used litterfall as an index of annual aboveground productivity (e.g., ). Five litterfall baskets (collection area 0.11&#xA0;m) were placed at random coordinates throughout each 90&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;90-m plot. Baskets were placed in the field at the beginning of September 2005 (after canopy manipulations had been applied). Samples were collected quarterly: in early April, mid-June, mid-September, and early December every year. Leaf litter was sorted to major species groups (, , , , , other deciduous trees), whereas twigs, bark, and reproductive parts were pooled into one category. After sorting, samples were oven-dried at 70&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 48 h prior to weighing. Annual litterfall is reported as the total of the June, September and December collections, plus the subsequent year&#x2019;s April collection.Measurements of soil carbon (C) flux (&#x201C;soil respiration&#x201D;) were made using a vented, flow-through, non-steady-state system () at six randomly chosen locations in the 30&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;30-m core area of each of the six hemlock (control, girdled, logged) plots (2003&#x2013;2009) and at two randomly chosen locations in the two hardwood control plots (2006&#x2013;2007). At each location, soil respiration collars, each 25&#xA0;cm in diameter (0.05&#xA0;m surface area) and made from thin-walled polyvinylchloride (PVC) tubing cut into 10&#xA0;cm lengths, were inserted &#x2248;5&#xA0;cm into the ground. Soil respiration was measured manually every 2 weeks during the growing season between 09:00 and 15:00 h using a Li-Cor 6252 portable Infrared Gas Analyzer (IRGA) (Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) mounted on a backpack frame. The IRGA was connected to a vented white acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) chamber top (10&#xA0;cm in height) that was then placed over the soil respiration collar. A pump circulated the air at 0.5&#xA0;L&#xA0;min from the chamber top through the IRGA and back to the chamber top. The chamber top was left on the collar for 5 min, and the change in  concentration within the chamber was recorded using a Hewlett-Packard HP 200LX palmtop computer (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, California, USA). The calibration of the IRGA was checked each day that measurements were made using both zero  and 594&#xA0;mL&#xA0;L certified standards. A linear regression of concentration of  versus time was used to determine the soil respiration rate, which was then corrected for local atmospheric pressure and chamber air temperature. The response variable used in subsequent analyses of treatment effects was soil respiration for the entire sampling period (Day of Year [DOY] 191-273) each year; this value was estimated by linearly interpolating soil respiration measurements between sampling days for each collar and then summing (integrating) all values over the 82-day sampling period.Total soil respiration is the sum of two belowground components: heterotrophic (microbial and microfaunal respiration) and autotrophic (root respiration). Measurements of soil respiration in the control plots represent the sum of these belowground processes. Thus, to a first approximation, differences in soil respiration between control and either logged or girdled treatments reflect the contribution of eastern hemlock to autotrophic respiration. Decreased soil respiration due to treatment effects were calculated by taking the pre-treatment soil respiration over the sampling season and subtracting from it the post-treatment seasonal soil respiration. These decreases represent a conservative estimate of autotrophic soil respiration in treated plots. Potential limitations to this method include the loss of root biomass, which could reduce heterotrophic respiration of soil organic matter via lack of priming, and that the newly severed roots may temporarily increase carbon available for heterotrophic respiration.Because the majority of live tree roots in each plot were killed following logging or girdling of hemlock, and because the percent cover of other vegetation in these treatments at the beginning of this study was very low (&lt;2%), seasonal sums of soil respiration in these canopy manipulation treatments can be used as estimates of heterotrophic soil respiration (; ).Nitrogen (N) mineralization measurements were begun in August 2003, two growing seasons prior to canopy manipulations, using a modified core method (; ). In the central 30&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;30-m area of each canopy manipulation plot, closed-topped cores were installed within four, 5&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;5-m, randomly located subplots each year at 7-week intervals during the growing season (May&#x2013;October), and for a 23-week overwinter (October/November&#x2013;April) incubation. At the beginning of each sampling period, soil was extracted with sharpened PVC cores (25-cm long) and immediately separated into mineral and organic layers. A second core was incubated in the field for 42&#x2013;50 days and then removed and separated by horizon. The bottom 2&#xA0;cm of each core was removed to prevent root invasion from below in incubated cores, and to standardize sample volume among the cores.Soil samples were returned to the laboratory on ice and processed the next day. Organic and mineral soils were passed through a 5.0-mm mesh screen, weighed for total mass, and subsampled for gravimetric moisture and inorganic N. To determine soil &#x2013;N and &#x2013;N concentration,&#xA0;&#x223C;&#xA0;10 g of organic and mineral soil were placed into 100 ml of 1&#xA0;M KCl for 48 h (). Soil extracts were filtered through a coarse pore filter (0.45&#x2013; 0.6&#xA0;&#xB5;m) and inorganic N concentrations were determined colorimetrically with a Lachat 8500 flow-injection autoanalyzer (Lachat Instruments, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA), using the salicylate () and cadmium reduction methods () for &#x2013;N and &#x2013;N, respectively. Net N mineralization was calculated as the difference in concentration of inorganic N () in incubated cores minus that in initial samples.An additional assessment of forest floor N availability and mobility was determined at each soil subplot using mixed-bed cation + anion resin bags (). Approximately 10 g of resin was placed in nylon mesh bags and pretreated with 2&#xA0;M KCl before deployment for 6-month intervals (growing season and overwinter). Resins were deployed at the forest floor &#x2013; mineral soil interface within 5&#xA0;cm of where the N mineralization incubations were located. Resins were returned to the laboratory on ice, dried at 105&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 24&#xA0;h, and extracted in 2 M KCl. Inorganic N was determined by the methods described above for soil N extracts.The experimental design is a one-way blocked analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) (; ), and analyses reported here were executed using the lme function in the nlme package in R version 2.9.2 (; ). In this design, the four canopy manipulations (hemlock control, hemlock girdled, logged, hardwood control) were treated as &#x201C;fixed&#x201D; factors, the two blocks were treated as &#x201C;random&#x201D; factors, and time entered the model as a covariate. Measures of vegetation structure and ecosystem function parameters were log-transformed as needed to normalize data and equalize variances; data are plotted back-transformed (). Comparisons among treatments were done using  contrasts. Although two blocks is the minimum required to allow for estimates of variance within treatments, this small number of blocks provided relatively low statistical power to detect true differences among treatments (i.e.,&#xA0;the probability of a Type II error &#x2013; falsely accepting the null hypothesis &#x2013; is high). Further, the absence of replication of treatments within blocks precluded estimation of a block&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;treatment interaction. Such trade-offs are inevitable in hectare-scale, decades-long experiments, however.All data presented in this paper are publicly available through the Harvard Forest Data Archive (), in a suite of datasets: HF106 (understory vegetation), HF126 (overstory vegetation), HF161 (litterfall), HF125 (coarse woody debris), HF119 and HF130 (soil respiration), and HF179 (nitrogen pools and dynamics).
