Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Brazilian Federal Law number 11.794, which regulates the scientific use of animals. All animals were handled in strict agreement with good animal practice according to the institutions guidelines for animal husbandry and all protocols were approved by the Committee of Ethics on the Use of Animals from Instituto Butantan (CEUAIB) under license 595-09.The  (BH strain) entire life cycle is maintained routinely in  snails and hamsters at Laborat&#xF3;rio de Parasitologia &#x2013; Instituto Butantan. Cercariae were prepared for mice infection or challenge by exposing infected snails to light for 2 h to induce shedding; their number and viability were determined using a light microscope prior to infection.The recombinant tegument nucleotidases have been previously characterized, expressed and purified, therefore we used the hexahistidine-tag expression vectors in which the respective cDNA sequences were directionally cloned: pAE-6His vector for SmAP and SmNPP-5 (; ) and pET 21-b vector (Novagen) for SmNTPDase (). These plasmids were used to transform  BL21 Star (DE3) pLys (Invitrogen), which were grown in LB medium plus ampicillin (100 &#xB5;g/mL) until reaching OD 0.6. Isopropyl-&#x3B2;-D-thiogalactopyranoside (Invitrogen) was added to the culture to a final concentration of 1 mM and cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 &#xB0;C. Then cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.5, 0.3 M NaCl). The cell suspension was passed three times (2000 psi each) through a French press and the crude homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000&#xD7;g for 30 min. The pelleted inclusion bodies were washed twice with wash buffer (lysis buffer plus 2 M urea) and finally resuspended in solubilization buffer (lysis buffer, 5 mM &#x3B2;-mercaptoethanol, 20 mM imidazole, 8 M urea).The recombinant proteins were then purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography using the &#xC4;kta Prime system (GE Healthcare) under denaturing conditions, as previously described with slight modifications (; ; ). Briefly, the samples were loaded onto a 5 mL bed volume Ni-NTA column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The columns were washed with 10 bed volumes of the equilibration buffer and then eluted with a 20&#x2013;500 mM imidazole linear gradient. The main peak was pooled and the protein purity of fractions was assessed using sodium dodecyl sulfate &#x2013; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Further, the elution fraction was dialyzed against Phosphate Buffer Saline pH 7.4 (PBS) and protein concentration measured with DC Protein Assay (BioRad) prior to use of these proteins ().Six to eight week-old female C57BL/6 mice from the Faculdade de Medicina &#x2013; USP animal facility were supplied with food and water . The animals were divided into five groups with 10 mice each: Control, SmAP, SmNPP-5, SmNTPDase and the 3 combined proteins (3Teg-Nucl). The animals were lightly anaesthetized (45 mg/kg of Ketamine and 10 mg/kg of Xylazine) before they were injected subcutaneously in the nape of the neck with 3 doses, at 15-day intervals. The SmAP, SmNPP-5 and the SmNTPDase animals were immunized with 25 &#xB5;g of the respective recombinant protein mixed with Freund&#x2019;s Complete Adjuvant in the first dose (Sigma) or Freund&#x2019;s Incomplete Adjuvant (Sigma) in the subsequent doses. The animals immunized with 3Teg-Nucl received 25 &#xB5;g of each recombinant protein with Freund&#x2019;s adjuvant, while the control group was inoculated with PBS with Freund&#x2019;s adjuvant using the same immunization protocol.Fifteen days after the last dose, mice were challenged with cercariae. The animals were anaesthetized with Ketamine (90 mg/kg) and Xylazine (10 mg/kg) and exposed percutaneously for 30 min to 100 cercariae in water on their shaven abdomens by the ring method. Forty five days after percutaneous challenge, animals were euthanized with a lethal dose of urethane solution (150 mg/mL) (Sigma). Perfusion fluid (saline solution plus 500 units/L of heparin) was pumped into the aorta artery, and perfused worms were collected from the hepatic portal vein and counted using a stereomicroscope.The protection was calculated by comparing the number of worms recovered from each vaccinated group with the control group, using the formula:  where WRCG = worms recovered from control group and WREG = worms recovered from experimental group. To evaluate the liver-trapped egg burden, a piece of the liver from each mouse was removed, weighed, digested and homogenized for 1 h at 37 &#xB0;C in 5 mL of 10% KOH. The number of eggs per gram of liver was compared to the control group (). All these data were statistically compared by ANOVA followed by Dunnett&#x2019;s test and a &#x3C1; &#x2264; 0.05 was considered significant.Mice were bled from the retro orbital plexus one day before cercariae challenge (day 44) and one day before mouse perfusion (day 89). The blood was processed and the sera collected were used to perform indirect ELISA assays to confirm the levels of specific anti-nucleotidases total IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a. Maxisorp 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc) were coated with 5 &#xB5;g/mL of recombinant SmAP, SmNPP-5 or SmNTPDase in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6 for 18 h at 4 &#xB0;C, then blocked for 1 h at 37 &#xB0;C with 200 &#xB5;L/well phosphate buffer saline, pH 7.2 with 0.05% Tween-20 plus 10% fetal bovine sera (PBS-T). The serum of each animal was serially diluted starting at 1:50, and incubated for 1 h at 37 &#xB0;C. Plate-bound antibodies were detected by goat anti-mouse IgG, IgG1 or IgG2a (Southern Biotech) diluted in PBS-T 1:10,000, 1:1,000 or 1:1,000, respectively. Finally the plates were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG diluted 1:20,000 for 1 h at 37 &#xB0;C and color reaction was developed by incubation of o-Phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) in citrate buffer, pH 5.0 plus 0.04% HO for 15 min and stopped with 4 M sulfuric acid. The plates were read at 492 nm in an ELISA plate reader (Labsystems). As background of ELISA assays presented an OD around 0.05, we selected the dilutions closer to OD 0.1 to correlate with standard curves, which were generated using mouse IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a (Southern Biotech). Statistical comparisons were performed with ANOVA followed by a Tukey&#x2019;s pairwise comparison. A &#x3C1; value &#x2264;0.05 was considered statistically significant.Cytokine experiments were performed using splenocyte cultures from individual mice (4 animals for each group) immunized with isolated or combined tegument nucleotidases as described above. Splenocytes were isolated from macerated spleens 15 days after the third immunization, and washed twice with sterile PBS. After washing, the cells were adjusted to 1 &#xD7; 10 cells in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine sera, 100 U/mL of penicillin G sodium, 100 &#xB5;g/mL of streptomycin sulfate, 250 ng/mL of amphotericin B and polymyxin B (30 &#xB5;g/ml). Splenocytes were restimulated in culture with each recombinant nucleotidase (5 &#xB5;g/mL) or concanavalin A (ConA) (5 &#xB5;g/ml) for 48 h in an incubator at 37 &#xB0;C with 5% CO. Culture supernatants were collected for IFN-&#x3B3; and IL-4 analysis using an ELISA kit according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s directions (Peprotech).RNA from splenocytes was extracted and purified using Trizol (Invitrogen) and cDNA was synthesized using the Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). RT-PCR of the sample was performed in a thermal cycler under the manufacturer instructions using random hexamers. The following genes were analyzed using Taqman Gene Expression Assays for gene quantification: &#x3B2;-actin (4352933E) as a housekeeping gene, MyD88 (Mm00440338_m1), NF-&#x3BA;B1 (Mm00476361_m1), NF-&#x3BA;B2 (Mm00479807_m1), IL-4 (Mm00445259_m1), IL-5 (Mm00439645_m1), IL-10 (Mm00439616_m1), IL-12p40 (Mm01288992_m1), IL-13 (Mm00434206_g1), IL-17 (Mm00439619_m1), IFN-&#x3B3; (Mm00801778_m1), TNF-&#x3B1; (Mm00443258_m1) and TGF-&#x3B2; (Mm00441724_m1). The level of &#x3B2;-actin was used to normalize the amounts of assayable RNA in each sample and quantitation of relative differences in expression were finally calculated using the comparative &#x394;&#x394;Ct method (), using the expression levels of PBS-immunized animals as baseline controls. Statistical comparisons were performed with ANOVA followed by a Tukey&#x2019;s pairwise comparison. A &#x3C1; value &#x2264;0.05 was considered statistically significant.Six to eight week-old female C57BL/6 mice were divided into control and subcurative PZQ treated groups containing 4 animals each and mice were infected with cercariae as described above. The subcurative PZQ treated animals received two doses of 150 mg/kg of PZQ by gavage, 35 and 37 days after infection respectively; saline solution was administered for control animals (adapted from ). Two hours after the second PZQ dose, animals were perfused to recover parasites as described above. Recovered worms were fixed in Formalin&#x2013;Acetic acid&#x2013;Ethanol solution and analyzed with a laser confocal microscope (LSM 510 META, Zeiss) at 488 nm wavelength of excitation and 500&#x2013;550 nm wavelength of emission. The tubercle numbers from control and treated groups were compared with Student&#x2019;s T-test (based on ).
