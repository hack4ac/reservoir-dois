We generated new ITS and L-F sequences from 56  samples representing all 27 minimum-rank taxa (species and subspecies) in the most recent revision of the genus (;  and ). An additional ITS sequence was generated for &#x2014;a close relative of  ()&#x2014;for use in rooting the ITS tree.  and  tissues for DNA analysis were taken from greenhouse or garden plants (). Tissues were obtained by D. Burge, Walter R&#xF6;&#xF6;sli, Nicholas Plummer, and Anurag Agrawal. Specimens were identified by W. R&#xF6;&#xF6;sli, N. Plummer, or D. Burge according to the taxonomic revision of  and subsequent descriptions of new taxa (; ). Plants were selected based on geographic distribution, with a larger amount of sampling for widespread taxa. Between one and eight populations of each taxon were used ( and ). Additional non-L-F sequences, for rooting trees, were obtained from GenBank ( [EF456206],  [EF456122],  [EF456119],  [EF456243], and  [EF456174]). These taxa were selected on the basis of their close relationship with  ().Total genomic DNA was extracted from silica-dried leaves or seeds using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. For seeds, up to three excised embryos from a single parent plant were pooled prior to DNA extraction (). DNA was extracted from seeds when silica-dried material for the same plant was not available, or proved recalcitrant to extraction of high quality DNA. All polymerase chain reactions were performed using Qiagen  DNA Polymerase. Amplifications were performed using an initial incubation at 94&#xB0;C for 10 min and 30 cycles of three-step PCR (1 min at 94&#xB0;C, 30 s at 45&#xB0;C, and 2 min at 72&#xB0;C), followed by final extension at 72&#xB0;C for 7 min. PCR was performed on a Perkin Elmer GeneAmp thermocycler. The primers ITS4 () and ITSA () were used to amplify the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA. Primers &#x2018;c&#x2019; and &#x2018;f&#x2019; () or a combination of these with internal primers &#x2018;d&#x2019; and &#x2018;e&#x2019; were used to amplify the L-F chloroplast region. For some plants, sequencing of ITS was problematic as a result of variation in length among ITS copies present in individual plants. Consequently, cloning of the ITS region was required for some plants. Cloning was carried out using the pGEM-T Easy Vector kit (ProMega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. NIA inserts were amplified directly from up to four positive colonies using the PCR protocol described above. For all PCR reactions, excess primer and dNTPs were removed using exonuclease I (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA [NEB]; 0.2 units/&#xB5;l PCR product) and antarctic phosphatase (NEB; 1.0 unit/ &#xB5;l PCR product) incubated for 15 min at 37&#xB0;C followed by 15 min at 80&#xB0;C. For sequencing we used Big Dye chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Sequences were determined bidirectionally on an Applied Biosystems 3100 Genetic Analyzer at the Duke University Institute for Genome Science and Policy Sequencing Core Facility.All sequences were assembled and edited in Sequencher 4.1 (Gene Codes Corporation). In the case of the five plants for which ITS was cloned, we assessed sequence variation using an alignment of cloned sequences (hereafter &#x2018;isolates&#x2019;). Two plants yielded pools of identical isolates (P011 and P021, ), one yielded four different types of isolate (P053), and two were represented by a single successfully cloned isolate (P046 and P048). For the plant with more than one isolate type (P053), we included all four isolates in the phylogenetic analyses of ITS; for the plants with identical isolates, we selected a single isolate to represent each plant. New ITS and L-F sequences for  were deposited in GenBank ().The 60 new ITS and 55 new L-F sequences, along with additional outgroup sequences from GenBank, were used to create separate alignments for the two regions (;  and ). Sequences were aligned in MUSCLE () under default settings. For ITS, several indel- and repeat-rich regions (54 bp total) were excluded due to alignment ambiguity. A portion of L-F not available for some taxa (the 3&#x2032; L intron) was recoded as missing data. Indels were not recoded for analysis.

Preliminary analyses showed that for the single  sample represented by more than one cloned ITS sequence (P053; ), the four sequences formed a monophyletic group. Thus, a single sequence from this group was selected at random. For the final combined alignment (), the entire L-F region was coded as missing data for the two  samples from which L-F was not obtained ( A049 and  subsp. , P066). To test for conflict between the nuclear (ITS) and chloroplast (L-F) portions of the alignment, we used the incongruence length difference test (), implemented in PAUP* v 4.0 () as the partition homogeneity test. The test used 1000 random repetitions of the parsimony analysis described below (see Phylogenetic analyses). Results showed significant disagreement between ITS and L-F ( = 0.047; 953/1000 trees). To account for this conflict, we ran all of our phylogenetic analyses on the separate L-F and ITS alignments, noting any well-supported conflicts between the results, and compared these to results from the combined alignment (see Discussion).Trees were reconstructed using Bayesian, maximum likelihood (ML), and maximum parsimony (MP) techniques. Bayesian analyses were carried out based on the best fit model of evolution from jModelTest 2, under default parameters (; ; ; ITS: GTR +I +G; L-F: GTR +I). Bayesian sampling was performed in MrBayes v 3.2.1 (), using the models of sequence evolution identified by jModelTest 2; all other parameters of MrBayes were left at default values; for the combined tree, no rate or model constraints were imposed between the two partitions. Analyses were carried out as follows: (1) three separate runs of 1 &#xD7; 10 MCMC generations, sampling every 1000 generations, (2) examination of run output for convergence (standard deviation of split frequencies nearing 0.001) (3) removal of the first 1000 samples (10%) as burnin after visual inspection of likelihood score plots, (4) comparison of consensus trees for each run, and (5) combination of post-burnin samples from all three runs to compute a 50% majority-rule consensus tree (conducted in PAUP* v 4.0 ()). A partitioned model of sequence evolution was used for the analysis of the combined data.Maximum likelihood analyses were carried out in GARLI v 2.0 (). For each alignment, two search replicates were performed in a single execution. Models of evolution were the same as those described for Bayesian analyses, with a partitioned model applied to the combined alignment. Other parameters were kept at default. Statistical support was inferred with 100 replicates of bootstrap reweighting (), implemented as in the tree search.Maximum parsimony analysis was conducted in PAUP* v 4.0 (). An initial heuristic search of 100 random taxon addition replicates was conducted with tree-bisection-reconnection branch swapping (TBR) and MULPARS in effect, retaining only ten trees from each replicate. A strict consensus of these trees was then used as a constraint tree in a second heuristic search using the similar parameters as above, but with 1000 random sequence addition replicates, and retaining 100 trees per addition replicate. We used this method due to the excessive number of trees generated by unconstrained searches. This strategy checks for shorter trees than those found by the initial search, demonstrating that the final consensus tree reflects all of the most parsimonious trees (). We also ran searches on the three alignments using an unconstrained search with the nearest neighbor interchange (NNI) swapping algorithm, which produced trees of exactly the same length as the constrained searches. In the interest of brevity, we present results only for the constrained searches. We estimated Bootstrap support () for our parsimony trees using 100 pseudoreplicates and the same search setting as described above, including use of a constraint tree. We treated gaps as missing data for all phylogenetic analyses.We used Templeton&#x2019;s nonparametric test (1983), as implemented in PAUP* v 4.0 (), to evaluate several key phylogenetic relationships. Templeton&#x2019;s test compares pairs of topologies, measuring relative statistical support for the trees within a sequence dataset (alignment). For these tests, we compared the best tree from the original parsimony tree search (see above) to the best tree from a search using a constraint (e.g., African  constrained as monophyletic). For more on these tests, see below (Results).
