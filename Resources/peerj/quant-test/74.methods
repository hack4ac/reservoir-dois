Sequence data from species for which full genome data is available were obtained from the NIAID Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) online through the web site at  (), as well as the NCBI RefSeq database. This selection was checked against, and supplemented with, data from previous publications regarding  phylogeny (; ; ). Multiple HCV genotypes were included, but otherwise, for each species, only one strain was analysed. In total, sequences from 7 , 11  (including the 6 HCV genotypes), and 69  species were used, as shown in . About half of these species have fully annotated genomes; in these cases the annotated NS3 sequence was used (). For the rest, the start and end positions of the NS3 sequence within the whole genome polyprotein was inferred from alignments with closely related annotated species. Thus, only the amino acid sequence corresponding to NS3, determined in this way, was used for the multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis (for details see ).Alignments of the NS3 protein sequence () were created using MUSCLE, version 3.7 (), and checked visually using Jalview, version 2.7 (). Only unambiguous homologous regions were retained for phylogenetic analysis; manual masking and trimming was performed in MacClade, version 4.08 (). ProtTest, version 1.3 () was used to estimate the appropriate model of sequence evolution. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by three separate methods. To obtain the Bayesian tree topology and posterior probability values, the program MrBayes, version 3.1.2 was used (). Analyses were run for 1 million generations, removing all trees before a plateau established by graphical estimation. All calculations were checked for convergence and had a splits frequency of &lt;0.1. Maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis was performed using PhyML, version 3.0 () and RAxML, version 7.0.0 () with 100 bootstrap replicates. Trees were visualised using FigTree v1.2 (). Nodes with at least 0.95 posterior probability and 80% bootstrap support were considered robust, and nodes with at least 0.80 posterior probability and 50% bootstrap support are indicated.In order to elucidate  the 3D structures of compounds C4, C12 and the HCV helicase the docking suite ZDOCK, version 3.0 was used (). ZDOCK is a protein-protein docking suite that utilizes a grid-based representation of the molecular system involved. In order to efficiently explore the search space and docking positions of the molecules as rigid bodies, ZDOCK takes full advantage of a three-dimensional fast Fourier transformation algorithm. It uses a scoring function that returns electrostatic, hydrophobic and desolvation energies as well as performing a fast pairwise shape complementarity evaluation. Moreover, it uses the contact propensities of transient complexes of proteins to perform an evaluation of a pairwise atomic statistical potential for the docking molecular system. RDOCK was utilized to refine and quickly evaluate the results obtained by ZDOCK ZDOCK (). RDOCK performs a fast minimization step to the ZDOCK molecular complex outputs and ranks them according to their re-calculated binding free energies.Energy minimization was performed initially to remove the geometrical strain from the top-ranking hits of the docking experiments, since the proteins were treated as rigid bodies. Protein complexes were subjected to an extensive energy minimization run using the Amber99 () forcefield as it is implemented into the Gromacs, version 4.5.5 (), via the Gromita graphical interface, version 1.07 (). An implicit Generalized Born (GB) solvation was chosen at this stage, in an attempt to speed up the energy minimization process.In order to further explore the interaction space and binding potential of each docking conformation, the molecular complexes were subjected to unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations using the Gromacs suite, version 4.5.5 (). Molecular dynamics took place in a periodic environment, which was subsequently solvated with SPC water using the truncated octahedron box extending to 7&#x212B; from each molecule. Partial charges were applied and the molecular systems were neutralized with counter-ions as required. The temperature was set to 300 K and the step size was set to 1 fs. The total run of each molecular complex was fifty nanoseconds, using the NVT ensemble in a canonical environment. NVT stands for Number of atoms, Volume and Temperature that remain constant throughout the calculation. The results of the molecular dynamics simulations were collected into a molecular trajectory database for further analysis.Principal component analysis was done using Pymol, version r0.99 () and the Ca atom root-mean-square function of Deep-View, version 4.0.1 (). Analysis of the Molecular Dynamics outputs and trajectories was therefore focused on structural deviations of each molecular system from its original docking conformation. The molecular dynamics final conformations were initially evaluated with a residue packing quality function built-in the Gromacs suite, which depends on the number of buried non-polar side chain groups and on hydrogen bonding. Moreover, the suites Procheck, version 3.5 () Verify3D, version 1.0 () were employed to evaluate the structural viability of each protein complex upon the molecular dynamics simulations. Illustrations of the molecular systems were rendered with the aid of the Chimera suite, version 1.8 ().
