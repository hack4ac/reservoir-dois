3D coordinates were obtained from the X-ray solved, crystal structures of HCV helicases with RCSB codes: 1A1V and 8OHM. The 8OHM entry is the full length, unbound form of HCV helicase, whereas the 1A1V entry contains the full length HCV helicase co-crystalized with a single strand of an oligonucleotide. All generated 3D CSFV helicase models in this study are available via email request to the corresponding author. All generated 3D homology models are available to download at: 
            The amino acid sequence of Classical Swine Fever viral helicase was obtained from the GenBank database (accession no: NC_006551, entry name: Classical Swine Fever virus, complete genome). Using the Gapped-BLAST () through NCBI () the homologous species of the Hepatitis C virus helicase was identified, which was used as a template for the homology modeling of the Classical Swine Fever viral helicase. The structure of the HCV helicase has been determined via X-ray crystallography (). The sequence alignment was done using the online version of ClustalW (). The alignment was repeated using Hidden Markov Models and the result was the same as the one obtained by ClustalW, due to the fact that there are several anchoring conserved motifs throughout the alignment ().The homology modeling of the Classical Swine Fever viral helicase was carried out using the Modeller package (version 9.10) (). The RCSB entries 1A1V and 8OHM were both used as template structures. A different model was generated for each one of the two available HCV crystal structure. The sequence alignment between the raw sequence of the Classical Swine Fever and the full sequence of the 1A1V HCV helicase revealed almost 32% identity, whereas the identity percentage between the Classical Swine Fever and the full sequence of 8OHM HCV helicase does not exceed 35%. The sequence alignment identity percentage between the two HCV template structures is 93.33% due to the fact that these sequences originate from different HCV strains. The above mentioned identity scores are on the lower boundary at which conventional homology modeling techniques are applicable. The model that was based on the 1A1V HCV structure was chosen to be used for the purposes of this study, due to the fact that this structure file has been co-crystallized with a single-stranded oligonucleotide. The homology model method of Modeller comprises the following steps: First, an initial partial geometry specification, where an initial partial geometry for each target sequence is copied from regions of one or more template chains. Second, the insertions and deletions task, where residues that still have no assigned backbone coordinates are modelled. Those residues may be in loops (insertions in the model with respect to the template), they may be outgaps (residues in a model sequence which are aligned before the C-terminus or after the N-terminus of its template) or may be deletions (regions where the template has an insertion with respect to the model). For this study, though, outgaps have not been included in the homology modeling process. The third step is the loop selection and sidechain packing where a collection of independent models is created. The last step is the final model selection and refinement, where the final models are scored and ranked, after they have been stereochemically checked with the &#x201C;Protein Geometry&#x201D; module for persisting errors. Finally, necessary secondary structure predictions were performed using the NPS (Network Protein Sequence Analysis) web-server and the GeneSilico MetaServer, which confirmed the choice of the Hepatitis C virus helicase as a template for this study ().Electrostatic potential surfaces were calculated by solving the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation using the finite difference method as implemented in the PyMOL Software (). The potential was calculated on grid points per side (65, 65, 65) and the grid fill by solute parameter was set to 80%. The dielectric constants of the solvent and the solute were set to 80.0 and 2.0, respectively. An ionic exclusion radius of 2.0 &#x212B;, a solvent radius of 1.4 &#x212B; and a solvent ionic strength of 0.145 M were applied. Amber99 () charges and atomic radii were used for this calculation.Energy minimizations were used to remove any residual geometrical strain in each molecular system, using the Charmm27 forcefield as it is implemented into the Gromacs suite, version 4.5.5 (). All Gromacs-related simulations were performed though our previously developed graphical interface (). Molecular systems were then subjected to unrestrained MDS using the Gromacs suite, version 4.5.5 (). MDS took place in an SPC water-solvated, periodic environment. Water molecules were added using the truncated octahedron box extending 7 &#x212B; from each atom. Molecular systems were neutralized with counter-ions as required. For the purposes of this study all MDS were performed using the NVT ensemble in a canonical environment, at 300 K and a step size equal to 2 fs for a total 100 ns simulation time. An NVT ensemble requires that the Number of atoms, Volume and Temperature remain constant throughout the simulation.Evaluation of the model quality and reliability in terms of its 3D structural conformation is very crucial for the viability of this study. Therefore, the produced models were initially evaluated within the Gromacs package by a residue packing quality function which depends on the number of buried non-polar side chain groups and on hydrogen bonding. Moreover, the suite PROCHECK () was employed to further evaluate the quality of the produced Classical Swine Fever virus helicase model. Verify3D () was also used to evaluate whether the model of Classical Swine Fever virus helicase is similar to known protein structures. Finally, the  suite was used to evaluate the 3D geometry of the models in terms of their Ramachandran plots, omega torsion profiles, phi/psi angles, planarity, C-beta torsion angles and rotamer strain energy profiles.The design of the new series of molecules via structure-based drug design was conducted using Ligbuilder (version 1.2). This program will start from a &#x201C;seed&#x201D; compound that must be manually positioned in the 3D conformational space of the molecular system (). For the purposes of this study, the mercaptoethanol co-crystallized compound that was attached to the Cys431 residue of the HCV structure was used as seed structure. The structures of CSFV and HCV helicase were structurally superimposed and their coordinates recalculated within the same Cartesian molecular system. First the S-S bond between the attached compound on the Cys431 and the Cys431 was broken and the hydrogens were restored from where they were missing. Then the oxygen was removed since its existence would significantly reduce the number of fragments suitable for that seed-receptor arrangement. The remaining compound was used as a starting point for the &#x201C;growing&#x201D; algorithm of LigBuilder. The complex was energetically minimized using a molecular mechanics algorithm, having fixed the backbone of the protein. The detached compound was entered to be the starting point of the drug design algorithm and thus it was expected that this moiety would be present in this position on all the new compounds, as it was already known from the HCV crystal structure that it was capable of interacting with the Cys431 amino acid. The algorithm used the mercaptoethanol compound as a starting point and started to grow structures by combining different chemical fragments that it stores in its database. The criteria are to optimally utilize the available space of the receptor and to establish the maximum amount of interactions with the adjacent residues of the helicase. All the different compounds that were designed were deposited in a folder for further investigation. A similarity cut-off of 90% was used in order to make sure that structurally all the different compounds in that folder would be at least 90% different. The space available was filled-in with newly designed compounds, with the only size-limiting parameter being the pre-defined molecular weight of the compound. After 30 generations of the Ligbuilder growing genetic algorithm, a set of 1200 compounds was obtained, custom designed for the ssRNA channel of the CSFV helicase.In order to establish the complex structures of the CSVF helicase  and each one of the 1200 potential inhibitor compounds, the docking suite ZDOCK (version 3.0) was used (). Docking experiments were conducted on the models that had been energetically minimized and conformationally optimized using molecular dynamics simulations. ZDOCK is a protein-protein docking suite that utilizes a grid-based representation of the molecular system involved. In order to efficiently explore the search space and docking positions of the molecules as rigid bodies, ZDOCK takes full advantage of a three-dimensional fast Fourier transformation algorithm. It uses a scoring function that returns electrostatic, hydrophobic and desolvation energies as well as performing a fast pairwise shape complementarity evaluation. Moreover it uses the contact propensities of transient complexes of proteins to perform an evaluation of a pairwise atomic statistical potential for the docking molecular system. RDOCK was utilized to refine and quickly evaluate the results obtained by ZDOCK (). RDOCK performs a fast minimization step to the ZDOCK molecular complex outputs and re-ranks them according to their re-calculated binding free energies.In this study a hybrid QSAR study was conducted using the 1200 compounds from the previous drug design experiment. Since no biological activity data was available for these molecules, an  predicted Ki score was used to rank them that was primarily based on their docking scores. The aim of this analysis was initially to interpret the unique characteristics of various compounds in regards to their estimated activities and to provide the means required to establish a 3D-pharmacophore model that would enable us to more accurately screen for anti CSFV agents.We used the set of the 1200 structurally distinct inhibitor compounds, which was generated by the structure based drug design algorithm. The predicted inhibitory potential of those compounds, was associated with their conformations as they were submitted to the Pharmacophore Elucidation Query module of MOE (Group CC, 2012). The algorithm initially identifies all features common to the highest ranking compounds, as they were scored by the Ligbuilder scoring algorithm, as well as features present in the least ranking compounds. The first ones are retained, whereas the latter are discarded. Finally, a set of regression parameters are used to estimate the activity value of each compound in the training set. The relationship between the geometric fit value and activity value is utilized for this computation. Pharmacophore hypotheses showing best correlation in the 3D arrangement of features in a given training set compounds with the corresponding pharmacological activities are formed and ranked. Several structure activity relationship (SAR) pharmacophore models were derived from the training set of compounds.
