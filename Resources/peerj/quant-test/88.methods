Experimental protocols were approved by the Veterinarian Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Ferrara, by the Italian Ministry of Health and complied with the European laws on the use of laboratory animals (n. 08/2009). All surgery was performed under aseptic procedures and general anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Monkeys were pre-medicated with atropine sulfate (0.1 mg/kg i.m.; MONICO SpA, Italy) and Zoletil 100 (20 mg/kg i.m.; Virbac Laboratories, France), and anesthetized by isoflurane (Abbott SpA, IL, USA) for the whole duration of surgery. Antibiotics and analgesics were administered postoperatively and experiments were started at least two weeks after the surgery.Single-unit activity was recorded from areas F5 and F1 in three hemispheres of two behaving monkeys (). Monkeys MK1 and MK2 (one female and one male, weighing 5.7 and 4.9 kg, respectively) were trained to perform a grasping task while sitting on a primate chair. After training, a recording chamber (diameter 30 mm) and a head-restraining device were surgically implanted on the left and right hemispheres of MK1 and on the left hemisphere of MK2. The position of the chambers (assessed before implantation using computer tomography and magnetic resonance scans) allowed us to record from a cortical region spanning area F1, the whole PMv (areas F4 and F5) and the caudal part of the frontal eye field (FEF).Single-unit recordings were performed using varnish-insulated tungsten microelectrodes with impedance 0.15&#x2013;1.5 M&#x3A9; (measured at 1 kHz). During each experimental session, the microelectrode was inserted perpendicular to the cortical surface and was slowly advanced through the cortex by means of a microdrive (Kopf Instruments, CA, USA; step resolution: 10 &#xB5;m). The recorded signal was amplified &#xD7; 10000 (BAK Electronics, Germantown, MD, USA), filtered by a dual variable filter (0.3&#x2013;5 kHz bandwidth; VBF-8, KEMO Ltd., Beckenham, UK), digitized (PCI-6071E, National Instruments, USA) at a sampling rate of 10 kHz and stored on a PC for off-line analysis. Action potentials were discriminated on-line by a dual voltage-time window discriminator (BAK Electronics, Germantown, MD, USA) and fed to an audio monitor (Grass Instruments, USA) to give the experimenter an auditory feedback on the neuron discharge during testing. The recording microelectrodes were also used for intracortical microstimulation (ICMS; train duration: 50&#x2013;100 ms; pulse duration: 0.2 ms; frequency: 330 Hz; current intensity: 3&#x2013;40 &#xB5;A). Current intensity was controlled on an oscilloscope by measuring the voltage drop across a 10 k&#x3A9; resistor in series with the stimulating electrode. The accessible cortex was functionally explored through single-unit recordings and ICMS to assess the location of areas F1, F4, F5 and FEF. Criteria and functional characteristics described by  were used to distinguish motor and premotor areas. Briefly, area F1 is characterized by low threshold of excitability (3&#x2013;10 &#xB5;A), robust discharge during active movements and response to somatosensory stimuli, area F4 is characterized by higher excitability threshold (10&#x2013;40 &#xB5;A), axial/proximal movements, discharge during tactile stimuli of face/body and response to visual stimuli within peripersonal space, and area F5 is characterized by an excitability threshold similar to area F4 (10&#x2013;40 &#xB5;A) but ICMS-evoked hand/mouth movements, discharge during goal-directed actions and response during observation of actions or objects.Naturalistic tests were used to select neurons which were then examined through the experimental paradigm. Single-neuron activity was studied with reference to the execution of different hand/arm movements associated with different grip types or to the application of different sensory stimuli (). In particular, grasping neurons were distinguished from reaching-related ones by presenting small pieces of food (raisins, apple, peanuts) at different distances and in different right/left locations. Visual properties were tested by showing to the monkey a series of hand actions () and different objects (; ). Specifically, we tested canonical properties by presenting food and 3D objects (pleasant or unpleasant) of different sizes, shapes and orientations to the monkey, whereas mirror properties were tested by putting, grasping, holding and manipulating food and 3D objects in front of the monkey. In addition, we also tested visual properties in particular conditions, e.g., mimicking grasping in the absence of object or performing actions with tools. Testing was performed by an experimenter at different distances and in different right/left locations. This functional characterization, together with ICMS data, allowed us to select hand-related motor neurons selective for precision grasping.(A) The monkey had to execute a precision grip in order to open the door of the food container. The target door, back-illuminated by a LED, was covered by an outer sliding door (Door) that the experimenter opened at each trial onset, giving the monkey a go-signal to start moving the hand from the resting position. The dashed line (IR) represents an infrared barrier positioned in front of the apparatus. (B) Time sequence of events during the grasping task and neuron recording. During the flash conditions, the scene was briefly illuminated by a single 20 &#xB5;s xenon light flash delivered when the hand crossed an infrared barrier at 10 cm in front of the apparatus (PT-flash) or when both the thumb and index finger touched two small metal contact sensors attached to the sides of the to-be-grasped handle (T-flash).The pre-selected grasping neurons were studied by using a computer-controlled apparatus specifically designed to make the animal perform a reach-to-grasp task which naturally implied the execution of a precision grip in order to open the door of a small box and get a piece of food from the inside. The box was positioned at 30 cm in front of the monkey&#x2019;s chest, at the height of the animal&#x2019;s chin so that during the task, the monkey easily saw its own grasping hand (). The precision grip was performed on a small plastic cube (side 8 mm) serving as a door handle and buried in a vertical groove to force a precision grip. To ensure that the movement was accurately executed under all conditions, the to-be-grasped cube was translucent and dimly back-illuminated by a red light-emitting diode (LED). LED intensity was kept low enough to prevent vision of the approaching fingers. Each trial began with the hand of the monkey positioned on a plane in front of its chest, at rest position. An external sliding door covering the to-be-grasped handle was remotely opened by the experimenter, giving the monkey a go-signal to initiate the grasping task. The task was performed under four different conditions (), namely (i) grasping in light, when grasping was executed with continuous vision of the own movement, (ii) grasping in dark, when grasping was executed in absence of any visual information on the own movement, (iii) PT-flash condition, when grasping was executed in dark but with instantaneous visual feedback during the hand preshaping phase, and (iv) T-flash condition, similar to the PT-flash condition but with instantaneous visual feedback provided at hand-object contact. To exclude the systematic repetition of stereotyped movements, the order of presentation of the four conditions was randomized in each sequence and the time interval between two consecutive tasks was varied (usually in the 5&#x2013;10 s range). Specifically, each sequence started with the light condition, that was followed by the dark, PT- and T-flash conditions (in random order), and ended with a second light condition (data not shown) to confirm the stability of neuronal activity and to verify that the three consecutive dark conditions (i.e., dark, PT- and T-flash) did not modify kinematics. During flash conditions, the scene was briefly illuminated by a single 20 &#xB5;s-xenon light flash triggered by: (PT-flash) the signal of the hand crossing an infrared barrier at 10 cm in front of the apparatus or (T-flash) a signal delivered when both the thumb and index finger touched two small metal contact sensors attached to the sides of the to-be-grasped handle. The sensors used, i.e., E3FZ (Omron Europe BV, Hoofddorp, The Netherlands) for PT-flash and HEF4011B (NXP semiconductors, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) for T-flash, featured a latency time between signal and flash delivery of 1 ms for the infrared barrier cross (PT-flash) and 60&#x2013;120 ns for handle touch (T-flash). The same trigger signals were also acquired to align neuronal discharges during the subsequent analysis.In separate sessions, grasping movements of MK1 were recorded with a 3D-motion optical analyzer (Qualisys Motion Capture System, Qualisys, Sweden). Three adhesive infrared-reflective spheres (diameter: 0.3 cm, weight: 0.04 g) were placed as markers on the upper limb skin over three anatomical landmarks: the wrist (head of the ulna) and the last-interphalangeal joint of the thumb and index finger. Three infrared cameras, placed at about 1.5 m from the monkey, were used to record the position of the markers. The motion analysis system provided 3D coordinates of the markers in space and time, enabling off-line reconstruction of the movement of each marker. Movements were recorded at a sampling rate of 240 Hz, a value considered more than appropriate for biological motion of primates (). Wrist velocity and grip aperture (distance between the two markers placed on the fingers) were recorded in order to analyze the time of peak wrist velocity (measured from touch instant) and maximal grip aperture. Analyses were performed using Qualisys Track Manager software and custom MATLAB programs (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA).Differences in time of peak wrist velocity and maximal grip aperture among conditions () were analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test performed on the mean values across all sessions ( &lt; 0.05).(A) Representative example of the time course (in ms) of wrist velocity (in m/s) and size of grip aperture (in mm) during the precision grip task in each condition during a single trial. (B) Time of peak wrist velocity (in ms) measured from handle touch (mean of all sessions). (C) Maximal grip aperture (in mm; mean of all sessions). * &lt; 0.05 different from light condition (Kruskal-Wallis test).Neural responses were analyzed as follows. To firstly ensure that the response of a selected neuron was modulated by hand grasping, the difference in activity between pre-movement (baseline, 500 ms period before movement start) and movement-related epoch (MOV, from 250 ms before handle touch to 250 ms after) was statistically assessed for each neuron by a two-way repeated-measures (RM) ANOVA with Epoch (two levels) and Condition (four levels) as factors. Only neurons showing significant differences were further taken into consideration. The single-neuron spike train, aligned with respect to handle touch and averaged, was convolved with a Gaussian-Kernel function (window width: 20 ms) to obtain a spike density function (SDF) which provided a continuous (1 ms-bin) time-dependent measure of firing patterns. Differences among conditions in individual neuron firing rate ( and ) were assessed by a running two-tailed Student&#x2019;s t-test performed on a 100 ms-bin stepped through the trial by 20 ms increments ( &lt; 0.05). Moreover, to specifically study neuron sensitivity before and after finger contact with the object, epoch MOV was subdivided into two sub-epochs, namely pre-touch sub-epoch (from 250 ms before to object touch) and post-touch sub-epoch (from touch to 250 ms after it). To statistically validate the modulation of neuron discharge by the phasic visual presentation of the grasping hand, one-way RM ANOVAs with Condition (four levels) as factor, followed by Tukey&#x2019;s LSD post-hoc comparisons ( &lt; 0.05), were performed on normalized activity (to reduce inter-neuron variance) of flash-modulated neurons, considering peak discharge and mean discharge during epoch MOV (). Normalization was achieved for each neuron by dividing the SDF by the peak of maximal discharge across all conditions. Finally, to better characterize the properties of the considered flash-modulated neurons, an Ansari-Bradley dispersion test ( &lt; 0.05) was applied to the temporal distribution of discharge peaks of normalized activity ().
