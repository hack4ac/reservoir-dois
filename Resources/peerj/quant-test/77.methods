Species occupancy maps were created for all but the rarest species in Great Britain as has previously been described in . In summary, records were used from the Distributions Database of the Botanical Society of the British Isles (BSBI). All dated records from 1978 to 2011 were used in this study from all parts of Great Britain, except for the islands of the Outer Hebrides, Shetland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. A snapshot of the database was taken in November 2011 (). Any records of subspecies and variety were amalgamated with those of the species to which they belong. Microspecies in the genera , ,  and  were combined with records of the aggregate species, as were some other taxa such as , and . Taxonomy follows . The grid system used is that of the Ordnance Survey of the United Kingdom.Estimation of species ranges was done by selecting well-surveyed grid cells (4 km) from a pool of all records and generating detection/non-detection data from these. The spatial distribution of occupancy is modelled using variograms and these models are used to interpolate the occupancy probability across the whole area in a process called kriging. To avoid kriging over landscapes with different spatial structures Great Britain was separated into four partitions, Scotland, Wales, northern England and southern England. Northern England was defined as is traditional for the BSBI as vice counties including, and northwards from, South Lincolnshire, Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Cheshire (for biological recording purposes Great Britain is divided into 113 vice counties with fixed borders). For convenience these regions and countries will be referred to as the partitions. Partitioning the area is not entirely necessary, but does allow statistical comparison between partitions and species.Species without at least 50 occupancies in a partition were not considered in the analysis. Rare species tend to have the greatest biases in their recording and in the conservation efforts used to preserve them in their localities.Interpolated maps were created for two time periods 1978 to 1994 and 1995 to 2011. These periods were chosen because they are of equal length and both periods contain a national sample survey of 4 km grid squares. Selection of sample squares, creation of detection/non-detection data and the resulting estimates of recording effort, average occupancy and occupancy change are all described in detail in . Well-surveyed grid cells are defined as those that have had at least two days of surveying conducted in them and a minimum threshold of species recorded in each of those surveys. Details of these thresholds and discussion of the differences in recording effort between the different time periods is given in . Essentially, the process of kriging balances the spatial differences in recording and the selection criteria of grid cells balancing temporal differences. Furthermore, although the selection threshold is important, the method is insensitive to its precise value.Centre of mass was calculated using the following formula, where &#x2032; and &#x2032; are the coordinates of the centre of mass;  and  are the coordinates of each grid square and  is the predicted occupancy probability of grid square .  A custom made Perl (version 5.12.4) script was used to calculate the coordinates of the centre of mass from the occupancy probabilities calculated from kriging. The distance moved by the centre of mass between time periods was calculated using Euclidean geometry. Namely, Pythagoras&#x2019; theorem was used to calculate the magnitude of movement from the coordinates and trigonometric functions were used to calculate the direction.The mean July &amp; January temperatures of the ranges of each species were taken from . Dispersal syndromes were taken from  and .Statistical analysis and kriging was conducted using R, version 2.8.1. Variogram creation, fitting and kriging were conducted using the package GSTAT, version 1.0&#x2013;10 (). Data manipulations and reformatting were conducted in MS-Excel. Circular means and circular bootstrap confidence intervals where calculated using the R package &#x201C;Circular&#x201D; Version 0.4-3 ().
