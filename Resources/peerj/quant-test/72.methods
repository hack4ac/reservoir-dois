PDAG fat was produced from refined palm oil (RBDPO), provided by Sime Darby Jomalina Food Industries Sdn. Bhd. (Telok Panglima Garang, Selangor, Malaysia), through 1,3-lipase glycerolysis using Novozyme 435 lipase (Novozyme, Denmark) according to Malaysia Patent 201004803. Free fatty acid (FFA) and monoacyglycerides (MAG) were removed using short-path distillation (SPD) to achieve DAG purity of more than 80% (w/w). All chemicals used were of analytical grade except for GC and HPLC purposes, the solvents used were HPLC grade.The PDAG fat (400 ml) with free fatty acid (FFA) of less than 0.16% was subjected to dry fractionation using Mettler Toledo LabMax (Greifensee, Switzerland) reactor. The oil was first heated in the reactor for 20 min at 70&#xB0;C with stirring at 100 rpm to destroy all crystals. The oil was then agitated and cooled at controlled manner to the desired end-temperature. The examined process parameters were summarized in . The oil was hold in the crystalliser for stabilization followed by separation of the semi-slurry into olein and stearin using hydraulic filter press. The slurry was first fed into the filter press with a minimum pressure 2.0 bar/min. The filling period was 10 min with a maximum pressure 6.0 bar/min. The olein and stearin fraction were weighed and analysed.
                
              Ct = crystallisation temperature; Cr = cooling rate; As = agitation speed.IV was determined according to the AOCS official method Cd 1-25 (1993).Fatty acid composition was determined by the rapid method of AOCS Official Method Cd 14c-94 (1993). Analysis of fatty acid compositions was done by gas chromatography (Model: Autosystem XL, Perkin Elmer, USA). Fatty acids present in oil were first converted to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) before injecting into polar SP&#x2122;(Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) capillary column (0.25 mm i.d. &#xD7; 60 m &#xD7; 0.2 &#xB5;m), to obtain the fatty acid profiles. Temperatures maintained in the analysis were column oven: 130&#xB0;C, injection block: 250&#xB0;C and detector temperature: 250&#xB0;C. Carrier gas was nitrogen at 20 psi. The injection volume was 1 &#xB5;l.PDAG fat, olein and stearin fractions (100 &#xB5;l) were dissolved in solutions of acetone: acetonitrile (60:40) (v/v) (900 &#xB5;l) and then analyzed for triacyglycerol composition using reversed-phased high performance liquid chromatography (Waters 2695, Connecticut, USA) using AOCS method Ce 5C-93. The TG was separated using packed Supercosil&#x2122; LC-18 column (25 cm &#xD7; 4.6 mm i.d. &#xD7; 5 &#xB5;m) and eluted from the column using an acetone/acetonitrile (25:75 vol/vol) mobile phase at flow rate of 2 ml/min. The sample injection volume was 1 &#xB5;l. Detection of the TG was done using refractive index detector (Waters 2414, Connecticut, USA).SMP was measured according to AOCS Method Cc.3.25 (1993). Capillary tubes were filled with a 1 cm high column of melted fat. The capillary tubes were then rolled against a piece of ice before being chilled in a refrigerator at 101&#xB0;C for 16 h to solidify the fat. The tubes were subsequently attached with a rubber band to a thermometer and suspended in a 600 ml beaker of boiled distilled water. The bath temperature was adjusted to 8&#x2013;10&#xB0;C below the SMP of the sample, and heat was applied using a heating coil element to increase the bath temperature at a rate of 1&#xB0;C/min. The temperature at which the fat column rises was reported as the SMP.SFC was measured according to Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) Test Method p4.8 (2004) using pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry (Bruker NMS 120 minispec). The SFC of PDAG fat, olein and stearin fractions was measured at each separation temperature. The sample in the NMR tube was first melted at 70&#xB0;C for 30 min, followed by chilling at 0&#xB0;C for 90 min prior to measurement. Melting, chilling and holding of sample were carried out in pre-equilibrated thermostat water bath. The SFC temperature was set to 10, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65&#xB0;C. The percentage of SFC was based on three measurements.Thermal properties of the oil sample (3&#x2013;5 mg) was measured using a Perkin Elmer DSC Diamond with hyperDSC (PerkinElmer Ins., Bridgeport Avenue, Shelton, USA). The data processor was PerkinElmer Diamond DSC Auto-sampler. Nitrogen (99.99% purity) was use as the purge gas and flowed at 20.0 ml/min. The DSC instrument was calibrated with indium (m.p. 156.6&#xB0;C).
