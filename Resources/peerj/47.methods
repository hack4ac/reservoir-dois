 The sampling sites are located at the Churince oasis system on the west side of the Cuatro Cienegas Basin (CCB) at 740&#xA0;m above sea level. This valley has &lt;15.0&#xA0;cm of annual precipitation falling mainly during the summer. The dominant soil is gypsisol, and the predominant vegetation types are halophile and gypshophile grasses. As described before (), the Churince system consists of a spring, an intermediate lagoon, and a desiccation lagoon (Dry Lagoon), connected by short shallow creeks. Two sites separated by one kilometer were selected. One site borders a small river creek (River) (26&#xB0;50&#x2032;43&#x2033;N/102&#xB0;8&#x2032;18&#x2033;W), and has 60% of plant coverage. The grass  is the dominant plant. The other site is closer to a dry lagoon (26&#xB0;50&#x2032;53&#x2033;N/102&#xB0;8&#x2032;52&#x2033;W) and has only 10% of plant coverage. At this site the gypsophile grass,  is the dominant plant species. The sites have alkaline soils with slight variation in the pH of 8.5&#x2013;8.8.In January of 2007, 20&#xA0;kg of soil were collected from each site. The soil was mixed and used to construct microcosms of 1&#xA0;kg of soil in permeable bags of nylon mesh (25&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;25&#xA0;cm). The microcosms were sterilized by autoclaving followed by a dose of 25&#xA0;kGy of gamma rays (at the Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Nucleares, La Marquesa, M&#xE9;xico). One microcosm sample from each site was immediately used for DNA extraction as a control.In February 2007, plots of 8&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;8 m were established at each site. The plots were divided in 64 quadrants of 1&#xA0;m, and 40 microcosm bags were placed randomly within the plots as replicates. Every three months, three microcosm bags were collected randomly during a period of one year (3, 6, 9 and 12 months), 12 in total for each site. The remaining microcosms were deposited in the site in order to guarantee enough samples in each sampling period but not analyzed for this experiment. In addition, three samples from 15&#xA0;cm of undisturbed soil next to the microcosms in each plot were randomly collected at the beginning and end (12 months) of the experiment to describe the community that potentially could colonize the microcosms. 50&#xA0;g of each sample were stored in liquid nitrogen until DNA extraction. The remaining soil was stored in black plastic bags at 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C during one month until processing in the laboratory for biogeochemical analysis. Separate samples were oven-dried at 75&#xA0;&#xB0;C to constant weight for soil moisture determination by the gravimetric method (). Measurements of (C) forms were determined with a Total Carbon Analyzer (UIC Mod. CM5012), while nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) forms were determined using a Bran-Luebbe Auto Analyzer III (Norderstedt, Germany). Total and inorganic C were determined by dry combustion and coulometric detection (). Organic C was calculated as the difference between total and inorganic C. N and P concentrations were determined following acid digestion; N was determined using a modified Kjeldahl method (), and P was determined with the molybdate colorimetric method following ascorbic acid reduction (). Microbial C (micC) and microbial N (micN) concentrations were determined from field-moist samples by a chloroform fumigation extraction method ().Inorganic N ( and NO) was extracted from fresh sub-samples with 2 M KCl, followed by filtration through a Whatman No. 1 paper filter (), and determined colorimetrically by the phenol-hypochlorite method. Dissolved organic C, N and P were extracted in two grams of fresh material with deionized water after shaking for 1 h, and filtering through a Whatman #42 filter and a 0.45&#xA0;&#xB5;m nitrocellulose membrane (). Dissolved organic C (DOC) was determined by combustion and coulometric detection (). Dissolved organic N (DON) and dissolved organic P (DOP) were determined after acid digestion. DON was calculated as the difference between digested soluble N and  in deionized water extracts. The DOP was calculated as the difference between digested dissolved P and inorganic P (as orthophosphate).. To evaluate significant differences in biogeochemical soil parameters between sites and through the time during the microcosms experiment, we analyzed biogeochemical variables with a repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) with one between-subject factor (site: Dry Lagoon and River) and one within factor (sampling date: 3, 6, 9 and 12 months). In order to compare biogeochemical soil parameters between sites, and between disturbed and undisturbed soil in the last sampling date (12 months), we carried out a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (factor 1 levels: sites Dry Lagoon and River; factor 2 levels: undisturbed soil and microcosm).The relationship between microbial community composition in terms of the most abundant bacterial families, soil characteristics and samples (date and site) was analyzed by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). In this analysis, the samples are represented by a centroid. Its position is indicative of the relationship between a specific sample and either of the ordination axes. Soil characteristics are represented by vectors. Vectors of greater magnitude and forming smaller angles with an ordination axis are more strongly correlated with that ordination axis. High scores of absolute value for a given family or a given site on a CCA axis indicate that it is highly related to the axis and to the environmental variable exhibiting high correlation to the axis. All soil characteristics were tested for significant contribution to the explanation of the variation in bacterial family community composition with an ANOVA like permutation test to assess the significance of constraints. Only variables that were significant by the permutation test at the &#xA0;&#x2264;&#xA0;0.05 level were included in the CCA biplot. The CCA was performed using the package Vegan in R (). In the supplementary material, we added a DCA analysis without the restrictive variables for comparison (). Total DNA was extracted using the Soil Master DNA Extraction Kit (EPICENTRE Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions, with an additional step of bacterial isolation using the fractionation centrifugation technique described in . This step was performed on frozen 50 g soil samples before DNA extraction as a way of reducing the remaining concentrations of salts, polysaccharides and secondary compounds. DNA was stored at &#x2212;20&#xA0;&#xB0;C.In order to confirm sterilization in the control microcosms, the DNA region coding for 16S rRNA was PCR amplified using universal primers ( and ). Since no band was recovered in a PCR gel run using the sterilized soil, the sterilization was assumed to be effective. 16S rRNA genes were amplified from each sampling date (pooled DNA from the three subsamples was used as template) using the 939F (TTGACGGGGGCCCGCAC) and 1492R (TACCTTGTTACGACTT) paired primers. Sequencing was undertaken using the standard Roche 454 Titanium LIB-A kit with multiplex identifier sequence (MID) tags ()&#xA0;() at the Research and Testing Laboratory (Lubbock, TX). Mothur open-source software package (v 1.15.0) () was used for processing, clustering, and classification of the quality screened sequence data. Raw sequences were screened for potential chimeric reads using Chimera.slayer () and the linked SILVA template database (26%). Sequences containing homopolymer runs of 9 or more bases, those with more than one mismatch to the sequencing primer and those longer than 565&#xA0;bp were eliminated. Group membership was determined prior to trimming of the bar-code MID and primer sequence. Sequences were aligned against the manually curated bacterial SILVA 16S rRNA gene template using the nearest alignment space termination (NAST) algorithm (; ), and manually trimmed for the optimal alignment region (start = 28596,&#xA0;end = 38347), which yielded aligned fragments of 270 bp long, including both the V6 and V7 regions. Pre-clustering, based on the SLP clustering algorithm (), was used to reduce the effect of pyrosequencing errors on subsequent analysis. A pairwise distance matrix was calculate across the non-redundant sequence set, and reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 3% distance using the furthest neighbor method (). This matrix was used to calculate the similarity based on the Bray-Curtis and Jaccard Index between the samples in each site and to create a cluster diagram of sample similarity. The sequences and OTUs were categorized taxonomically using Mothur&#x2019;s Bayesian classifier and the SILVA bacterial reference set. A representative sequence from the center of each OTU grouping was classified using a na&#xEF;ve Bayesian approach (). The taxonomic reference database was composed of unique, full-length sequences from the SILVA SSU Ref v.106 database () (). To account for the effects of different sequencing depths on the alpha-diversity measurements, the sample sets were normalized to equal abundance of the sample with the least sequencing effort (Dry Lagoon, 9 months; 10,441 sequences; ). Alpha-diversity statistics including Chao1 non-parametric species richness estimate (calculates the estimated true species diversity of a sample based in the number of singletons and doubletons), Shannon indices, Shannon-based richness estimate (diversity indices as a quantitative measure that reflects how many different OTUs there are in the dataset, simultaneously takes into account how evenly the OTUs are distributed), and Good&#x2019;s coverage estimate (percent of the total OTUs represented in the sample), were generated for each sample using the same program.The GenBank accession numbers for 16S rRNA pyrosequences in this work are in the BioProject: PRJNA167137. The sample identifications for microcosms in the Dry Lagoon are: before sterilization SRS346170, at 3 months SRS346171, at 6 months SRS346172, at 9 months SRS346173 and at 12 months SRS346174. The samples ID for microcosms in the River are: before sterilization SRS346176, at 3 months SRS346177, at 6 months SRS346178, at 9 months SRS346179 and at 12 months SRS346180. The samples ID for the undisturbed adjacent soil at 12 months are SRS346175 for the Dry Lagoon, and SRS346181 for the River.
