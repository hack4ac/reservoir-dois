The schematic of the experiments conducted is depicted in . Sediment samples were collected on March 3, 2009, from a 63&#xA0;m deep station in Lake Washington, Seattle, Washington (47.038075&#x2019; N, 122.015993&#x2019; W) using a box core that allowed collection of undisturbed sediment. Samples were transported to the laboratory on ice and immediately used to set up microcosms. In order to assess populations active in methane oxidation under different oxygen tensions and to test for their potential dependence on the presence of nitrate we set up microcosm incubations as follows. One microcosm was incubated in an atmosphere of 50% C-labeled methane (99 atom % C, Sigma-Aldrich) and 50% ambient air, to assess the populations active in aerobic methane oxidation (the  condition); the second microcosm was incubated in an atmosphere of 50% C-methane and 50% ambient air, in the presence of 10 mM , to assess the populations active in aerobic methane oxidation positively responding to the presence of nitrate (the  condition); the third microcosm was incubated in an atmosphere of 50% C-methane and 50% , to assess the populations active in microaerobic methane oxidation (the  condition); the fourth microcosm was incubated in an atmosphere of 50% C-methane and 50% , in the presence of 10 mM , to assess the populations active in microaerobic methane oxidation positively responding to the presence of nitrate (the  condition). Each microcosm contained 50 ml of the top layer (1&#xA0;cm) of the sediment and 50 ml of Lake Washington water filtered through 0.22&#xA0;&#xB5;m filters (Millipore). Samples were placed into 250 ml glass vials (6 vials per experiment, the contents of which were mixed before DNA extraction) and these were sealed with rubber stoppers. The duration of the incubation time for each microcosm was determined empirically by observing the formation of a heavy, C-enriched DNA fraction. It took 10 days for heavy DNA band to appear in the  microcosm, compared to 15 days for the  microcosm, suggesting that the methane-consuming community was stimulated by nitrate. It took much longer for heavy DNA band to appear in the microaerobic microcosms (20 and 30 days, respectively, for nitrate-amended and nitrate-free conditions; ). These data suggest that nitrate also had a positive effect on methane consumption by the microbial community in microaerobic conditions.Schematic of experimental setup shows workflow, duration of each enrichment and actual DNA samples separated into heavy and light fractions.Community DNA was extracted as described previously () with one modification as follows: DNA samples were subjected to an additional round of purification using UltraClean Mega Soil DNA Isolation Kit (MOBIO). The heavy (C-enriched) fractions of DNA were separated from the light (C) fractions by CsCl-ethidium bromide density gradient ultracentrifugation, visualized under UV (), and collected and purified following standard procedures as previously described (). DNA from an untreated sediment sample was extracted using the same protocol. This sample was not subjected to density gradient centrifugation.Five shotgun libraries were constructed, one from each microcosm. The libraries were sequenced using the 454 sequencing technology at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) Production Genomics Facility. A total of 5,241,266 reads comprising 1.67 gigabases (Gb) of sequence were generated. These were assembled using the Newbler assembler. Assembly statistics are shown in .Sequencing, assembly, metagenome and pyrotag statistics.We used 454 pyrotag sequencing of the V8 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene to determine the compositions of microbial communities in the four C-enriched metagenomes using a computational pipeline PyroTagger, as previously described (), and we compared these to the community composition in the original (unamended) lake sediment sample. The number of total pyrotag sequences generated per microcosm is shown in . The PyroTagger assignments were used to calculate the Shannon-Weaver diversity index and the expected number of unique species rarefied to a constant value across all samples ().The draft quality assemblies were processed using the IMG/M pipeline () and the outputs of these automated analyses were manually verified and used for metagenome profiling.To classify the 16S rRNA gene sequences in the metagenomes, the 16S genes identified by JGI pipeline were aligned against the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) version 10, release&#xA0;26. The top scoring alignment for each sequence was used to assign taxonomy, based on the annotations in the RDP. Genes were classified to the family level.To detect  and  genes, respective peptides representing  and  were obtained from public databases and used as queries in pBLAST analyses against each dataset, and all matches were recorded. These queries pick each other and also the NC10 sequences. All matches were compared with sequences in public databases using pBLAST. Genus level assignments were made using an 80% identity cutoff level, and family level assignments were made at 70% identity cutoff, based on prior knowledge on gene diversity within each family ().To detect  genes, respective peptides representing  and  were obtained from public databases and used as queries in pBLAST analyses against each dataset, and all matches were recorded. These queries pick each other, other proteobacterial sequences as well as NC10, planctomycete and unclassified sequences. Genus and family level assignments were done as above.For the nitrogen metabolism genes, sequences were selected by their annotation and aligned against the NCBI&#x2019;s nonredundant database (nt). The top scoring hit for each sequence was saved. The NCBI taxon ID was extracted and the NCBI taxonomy database queried to collect the &#x201C;scientific name&#x201D; of each hit. The count of hits for each &#x201C;scientific name&#x201D; were reported. &#xA0;The following annotation search terms were used: &#x201C;itrate reductase&#x201D; for -reductase, &#x201C;itrite reductase&#x201D; for -reductase, &#x201C;itric[-]oxide reductase&#x201D; for NO reductase, &#x201C;itrous[-]oxide reductase for  reductase, and &#x201C;itrogenase&#x201D; for nitrogenase. The first letter was omitted to avoid conflicts with upper and lower case letters and in the case of NO and  reductases, both annotations (with and without &#x201C;-&#x201D;) were accepted.To classify  and  genes belonging to specific methylotroph families, high stringency pBLAST analyses were applied using 90% identity level cutoff at the protein level and employing publically available sequences of the respective enzymes representing the respective taxonomic groups.Taxonomic profiling of microcosms based on pyrotag analysis (A and B) and metagenome data analysis (C and D) shows high abundance of  and  in aerobic conditions.
