Methods
   
      Study populations
      The present study included 837 Spanish cutaneous melanoma patients. The cutaneous
         melanoma patients were recruited at the Department of Dermatology, Instituto Valenciano
         de Oncologia, a referral skin cancer center for the provinces of Valencia, Alicante
         and Castellón, with ~5 million population. Blood samples from melanoma patients with
         histopathologically confirmed diagnosis were collected between 2000 and 2007. Clinical
         and pathological data from the patients were prospectively collected since January
         2000 through the review of medical history, personal interviews and clinical examination
         by expert dermatologists. The patients were followed-up for a median of 88.8&nbsp;months
         (95% CI 83.1-94.4). The tumors were classified according to the AJCC stage system
         for pathological stage and the relative Breslow thickness was reported. The phenotypic
         characteristics of skin in cases were classified as Fitzpatrick phototypes after examination
         by a trained dermatologist. Information about hair and eye color was also documented.
         Spanish control included 1154 ethnically matched disease-free controls-individuals.
         Disease-free and ethnically matched healthy control subjects were recruited at the
         Transfusion Center of Valencia, Spain. The phenotypic characteristics of skin in controls
         were classified as Fitzpatrick phototypes based on a self-reported questionnaire.
      
      All the participants in the study signed an informed consent and the study protocol
         was approved by institutional ethic board of Instituto Valenciano de Oncologia.
      
      Selection and genotyping of the polymorphisms
      The polymorphisms on chromosome 9p21 were selected according to two criteria: polymorphisms
         previously reported to be associated in published GWAS on melanoma and nevi and polymorphisms
         selected through tagging approach to fine map the CDKN2A gene. Ten polymorphisms reported to be associated with melanoma and cutaneous nevi
         or both were included in the study (Figure&nbsp;1).

         with cutaneous nevi or melanoma risk or both in GWAS.
      
      The selection of the polymorphisms in order to fine map the CDKN2A gene was done using data on the Caucasian population from HapMap database (release
         #27). The 47.2 Kb (chromosome 9: 21956221–22003411; build 36.3) region encompassing
         CDKN2A and the nearby CDKN2B was scanned and 12 polymorphisms with a minor allele frequency ≥0.10 were identified
         using tagger program in Haploview using a minimum r2 of 0.8 (Figure&nbsp;2). A total of 25 polymorphisms were selected on chromosome 9p21 and genotyped in the
         Spanish melanoma cases and controls (Additional file 1: Table S1).

      Genotyping of the selected polymorphisms was carried out using a PCR based allelic
         discrimination method (KBiosciences UK). The amplification was carried out in a final
         volume of 4&nbsp;μl using 5&nbsp;ng of DNA, 2&nbsp;μl 2X reaction mix (KBiosciences, UK), 0.06&nbsp;μl
         of the solution containing 100 nM of two forward primers specific for two alleles,
         and one reverse primer mix. The reaction was performed under thermocycling conditions
         with an initial denaturation at 94°C for 15&nbsp;minutes, followed by 36–46&nbsp;cycles of 20s
         at 94°C and 60s of annealing (temperatures ranging from 60-50°C). Genotypes in amplified
         products were determined by differences in VIC and FAM fluorescent level in plate
         read operation on ABI PRISM 7900HT (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using SDS
         1.2 Software. Post operation data were transferred as Microsoft Excel files and converted
         into genotype informations.
      
      The samples for which genotyping failed in Kaspar assay were randomly sequenced. PCR
         for sequencing was carried out in a total volume of 10&nbsp;μl. The reaction contained
         10&nbsp;ng of DNA template, 1.0&nbsp;μl of 10X reaction buffer, 0.11&nbsp;mM of each dNTP, 0.20&nbsp;μM
         of each primer (Additional file 2: Table S2), 1.50&nbsp;mM of MgCl2 and 0.2 U (TAQ POL) of DNA Taq Polymerase (Genaxxon BioScience GmbH, Germany). Thermocycling
         conditions used were 94&nbsp;C for 5 min, followed by 3 cycles of 94°C for 45 seconds,
         annealing temperature (Additional file 2: Table S2) for 45 seconds, 72°C for 45 seconds followed by additional 35 repeated
         cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, annealing temperature (Additional file 2: Table S2) for 30 seconds and 72&nbsp;C for 45&nbsp;sec. The final step was 72°C for 5&nbsp;minutes.
      
      The amplified fragments were checked on 1% agarose gel. PCR product were purified
         by incubation for 30&nbsp;minutes at 37&nbsp;C with 0.75&nbsp;μl of ExoSAP-IT®(USB Corporation, Cleaveland,
         OH), followed by an incubation for 15&nbsp;minutes at 85°C. Cycle sequencing reaction on
         purified PCR products were performed using specific primers (Additional file 2: Table S2). The sequencing reaction was performed using Big Dye® Terminator Cycle
         Kit (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA). The reaction products were precipitated
         with isopropanol, washed in 70% ethanol and the precipitate was suspended in 25&nbsp;μl
         of water. The 96 well plates containing DNA were loaded on an ABI prism 3100 Genetic
         analyzer and the data were analyzed using a sequencing program (Applied Biosystem).

      Statistical analysis
      Genotype frequencies of all SNPs were tested in control subjects for deviation from
         Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium using Pearson’s X2 test. For association study, 63 patients with melanoma in situ (AJCC stage 0) were
         excluded from data analysis. The association between cutaneous melanoma and genotype
         of the polymorphisms was evaluated by odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI)
         and P values, using logistic regression (SAS version 9.2, SAS institute Inc., NC).
         Logistic regression models included age and sex as covariates. Analysis was also performed
         using a model selection that included all covariates.
      
      Gene-gene and gene-host factor interactions were carried out after a model selection
         based on likelihood ratio tests (LTR). The interaction analysis between the variants
         that showed association with the risk of melanoma and previously genotyped melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) variants was carried out by categorizing both cases and controls into carriers and
         non-carriers [18]. For MC1R categories selected were carriers of any (V60L, D84E, V92M, R151C, I155T, R160W,
         R163Q and D294H) MC1R variants versus non-carriers and analysis was also carried out by grouping red hair
         color (RHC; D84E, R151C, R160W and D294H) and non-RHC variants separately. All statistical
         tests were performed in SAS 9.2 software.
      
      Interaction contrast ratio ICR to test departure from additivity (&gt; or &lt; 0) and the
         multiplicative interaction index MII to test departure from multiplicativity (&gt; or
         &lt; 1) were also calculated in SAS 9.2. Confidence intervals and the p-values were calculated
         using bootstrap methods with 10000 simulations (SAS 9.2).
      
      Bioinformatic analysis
      The estimate of linkage disequilibrium between the polymorphisms in Spanish cases
         and controls combined was performed using SNP_tool package. The converted data were
         processed in the Haploview software (version 4.2) for linkage disequilibrium estimation.
      
      Analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in the eQTL browser (eqtl.uchicago.edu/Home.html)
         was performed for the statistically significant associated polymorphisms with melanoma
         risk and the tagged variants.
