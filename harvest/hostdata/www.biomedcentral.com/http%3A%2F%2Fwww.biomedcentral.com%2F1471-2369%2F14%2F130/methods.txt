Methods
   
      Animals
      Eighty male Sprague–Dawley rats (8 wks, 180~220 g) were used in this experiment. The
         animals were purchased from Zoology Institution of Hunan Agricultural University and
         raised in room temperature with natural illumination and ventilation. Their general
         health state and activity were monitored closely during the experiment. The experimental
         protocol for this study was pre-approved by the Hunan Normal University Institutional
         Review Board and in accord with the Public Health Service policy on the use of animals
         for research [10].
      
      Experimental procedure
      All the rats went through the adaptation training for one week by running on a horizontal-treadmill
         (slope gradient 0%, ZH-PT-1 Treadmill, Bio Equipment Co., Ltd. Huaibei, Anhui, China)
         at a speed of 15–30 m/min for 15–20 min every day. They were grouped randomly into
         4 groups of 20 animals: control group (C), exhaustive exercise group (ET), exhaustive
         exercise + rhEPO group (ET+EPO) and exhaustive exercise+ rhEPO + LY294002(PI-3- kinase
         inhibitor)group (ET+EPO+LY). Rats of group (ET+EPO) received intraperitoneal (ip)
         injection of 2000 u/kg rhEPO 30 minutes prior to the exercise every Monday, Wednesday
         and Friday. With the same schedules and EPO administration, rats of group (ET+EPO+LY)
         had an extra ip injection of 100 mg/kg LY294002 one hour prior to exercise. The over-training
         model was based on the modified exercise protocol proposed by Somani [11]. Animals of group ET, ET+EPO and ET+EPO+LY were imposed a treadmill running once
         a day repeatedly for four weeks at gradient 10% and speed of 30 m/min, simultaneously
         stimulated by sound, light, machinery until they were exhausted, e.g. unmovable, prostrating
         on the ground and gasping with no response to evade, which usually took 4 – 5 h. The
         running distance was recorded automatically with machine.
      
      Samples collection
      Twenty-four h after the exhaustive exercise, rats were anaesthetized by ip injection
         of 10% chloral hydrate (0.3 ml/100 g) and sacrificed by incising of the heart. The
         kidney was removed immediately for specimens. Nephridial tissue between cortex and
         medulla was dissected out and fixed with 10% paraformaldehyde. The tissue was sliced
         into small pieces (&lt; 1 mm3) and placed on the microscope slide immersed with glutaraldehyde fixative. The tissues
         were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde - 2.5% glutaraldehyde for two h at 4°C, washed
         for three times (10 min each) with buffer solution of sodium cacodylate (pH 7.2).
         After dewetting, the tissues were fixed by 1% H2OSO4 for 2 h at 4°C and washed again, fixed with 0.1 m buffer solution of sodium cacodylate
         and preserved at 0°C for electron microscopy examination. Same procedurals were applied
         for rats in control group except that the samples were collected one day after adaptation
         training.
      
      Hematoxylin eosin (HE) staining
      The fixed tissue was embedded in paraffin and cut into serial sections of 5 μm. The
         sections were dewaxed with dimethylbenzene and soaked for 2 min in 100%, 95%, 85%
         and 70% ethanol respectively for gradient rehydration, then washed for 2 min with
         distilled water and soaked for 15 min in Haematein dye liquor. After swashed with
         running water, the sections were soaked in 1% hydrochloric acid alcohol till them
         turned to pink, and swashed again for 15–30 min to make them back to blue. They were
         colored with 0.5% eosin stain for 1 min and dehydrated with 70%, 85%, 95%, 100% ethyl
         alcohol respectively, each for 2 min. Again, they were soaked 5 min in dimethylbenzene
         for two times to make them transparent. Finally, the sections were sealed with neutral
         balsam and photographed with OLYMPUS BX52 Microscopic imaging system (The JEOL institute,
         Japan, 40×10 times).
      
      Electron microscope specimen preparation
      The specimens were gradient dehydrated under 4°C with ethyl alcohol, 50% for 10 min,
         70% overnight, 90% 10 min and 100% 15 min twice, and replaced at room temperature
         with propylene epoxide for 15 min twice, 1:1 propylene epoxide and resin for 1 h,
         1:4 propylene epoxide and resin for 1 h and pure resin soakage for 2 h, followed by
         embedding in pure epoxy resin Epon812 and polymerized in thermostat, 35°C for 16 h,
         45°C for 8 h, 55°C for 14 h and 60°C for 48 h. The samples were trimmed and cut into
         serial sections of 60 nm positioned by azure-cyanine staining optical microscope.
         The sections were double stained with acetic acid uranium and lead nitrate and studied
         by a Hitachi H2600 Transmission Electron Microscope.
      
      Statistical analysis
      Data were analyzed by using statistical software SPSS (version 17.0 for Windows, SPSS,
         Chicago, IL, USA). All data are presented as mean ± SD. one-way ANOVA followed by
         Bonferroni test was used for comparisons. P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
