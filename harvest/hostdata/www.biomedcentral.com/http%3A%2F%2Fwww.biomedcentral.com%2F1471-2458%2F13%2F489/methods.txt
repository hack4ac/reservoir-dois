Methods
   
      We identified medicines considered by the PBAC for PBS listing in 2006 and 2007 [17]. We searched the ANZ Proquest Newsstand database [18] from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2008 to find Australian newspaper articles pertaining
         to these medicines. At the time of this study, the database included more than 40
         newspapers, covering the major daily and weekend newspapers of all capital cities
         and major regional centres [18]. Using generic and trade names, we searched the database for mentions of the medicine
         in the headline or text of reports and retrieved the full text of each identified
         article.
      
      We counted the numbers of stories appearing in the six months before, the month of
         the meeting and six months after the PBAC meeting. Each story was coded for the number
         of times the medicine name was reported (1, 2 or ≥3 mentions), assuming that more
         mentions would reflect a greater medicine focus in the newspaper report. Stories identified
         in the three year time window (2005–2008) were coded for reference to the PBS (either
         use of the term PBS or reference to Government subsidy or medicine subsidisation),
         and medicine costs (either patient costs if it was not subsidised, or Government costs
         for providing subsidised access).
      
      Each story was coded by two raters, with differences in categorisations resolved by
         consensus or by adjudication using a third reviewer where agreement could not be reached.
         Descriptive statistics are used to summarise the data.
      
      In addition to the quantitative analysis of the news reports, three case studies where
         there were larger numbers of newspaper articles published around the time of the PBAC
         recommendation are used to illustrate the content and tenor of some reporting.
