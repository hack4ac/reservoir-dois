				Embryonic development and morphological characteristics of Japanese devil stinger  Inimicus japonicus  during early life stage were investigated. Larvae were hatched out 50 h after fertilization at temperature 21°C. Total length of the newly hatched larva was 4.03 mm, the mouth of the larva opened at 3 days after hatching (DAH), and the yolk sac of the larva disappeared at 5 DAH. After hatching, the pectoral fin first developed, then the tail fin, dorsal fin, anal fin and pelvic fin continuously developed, and all fins formed completely at 15 DAH. The metamorphosis was complete at 25 DAH, and the body color and habit of the metamorphosed individuals were different from the larvae. At 30 DAH, the morphology and habit of the juveniles were the same to adults. In order to determine the suitable salinity for larviculture of  I. japonicus , salinity tolerance at different early developmental stages was compared in terms of the survival activity index (SAI) and mean survival time (MST). The results indicated that salinity tolerance varied with development stages. The optimum salinity range for newly hatched larvae was 10–25‰. Larvae showed low tolerance to low salinity (5‰) before the mouth opened, and the suitable salinities for the larvae with open mouth, yolk-sac larvae, post yolk-sac larvae were 10–15‰. The flexion larvae showed a wider salinity tolerance with range of 5–20‰. After metamorphosis, the juveniles showed a preferable adaptability of salinities of 15–20‰. The SAI and MST of individuals at various stages under different salinity conditions were positively correlated.
