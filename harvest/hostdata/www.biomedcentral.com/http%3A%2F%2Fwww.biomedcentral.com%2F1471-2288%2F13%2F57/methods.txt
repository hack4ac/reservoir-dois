      Estimating approximate UNIREP power with estimated covariance and fixed means
      By extending results in Muller et al. [5], the following lemma helps simplify the F approximations. Appendix B: Supporting lemmas and proofs contains all proofs.
      
      Lemma 1
      The constant in the critical value of the UNIREP test statistic approximation introduced
         by Muller et al. [5] is equal to 1,

         be carefully maintained between the estimation study and target study. The estimation
         study provides the covariance estimate and has sample size Nest, design matrix rank of rank (Xest), and νest=Nest−rank(Xest) degrees of freedom. The target study for which power is desired has sample size
         N, rank (X) and νe=N−rank(X) degrees of freedom.

      A better choice, given in the following lemma, uses a ratio of unbiased estimators.
         The result generalizes the rank-adjusted Huynh-Feldt estimator for data analysis.

            , 1 and 1/b was examined for each UNIREP test for the wide range of simulations discussed in
         Muller et al. [5]. The values chosen provided the most accurate results. In retrospect, they are natural
         choices as well.
      
      Approximate UNIREP power confidence intervals
      The solution to the UNIREP problem parallels the solution to the univariate problem
         in Taylor and Muller [16]. The methods apply to any general linear hypothesis, including one degree-of-freedom
         contrasts, such as pair-wise group comparisons and differences in linear trend between
         two groups. Tests giving scalar secondary parameters are also common for one-group
         designs and two-group comparisons. For known covariance and means, e5 is defined to be ∊n (Table 1), and the noncentrality in equation 9 is

      Taylor and Muller [16] recommended one-sided power confidence intervals by noting that “the change from
         a one-sided to a two-sided confidence interval has little effect on the upper bound,
         but a large effect on the lower bound”. Muller and Fetterman [20] provided examples of a one-sided power confidence interval in the univariate case.
      
      Approximate UNRIEP power confidence regions for power curves
      The new methods allow calculating a confidence interval for a single power value.
         The logic of a proof in Taylor and Muller ([16] equations 2.1-2.13 and surrounding text) guarantees that accurate confidence regions
         are provided by the point-wise calculations. The proof may be sketched for the present
         setting as follows. Equations 14-21 establish the validity of the approximate confidence
         interval for a particular alternative hypothesis, as specified by the scalar constant
         tr(Δ). The randomness in the noncentrality arises from a scalar random variable,

            , analogous to a variance. Equation 19 describes a single event with a specified probability.
         The inequality defining the event, and the associated probability, do not change for
         different values of the scalar constant tr(Δ). The smooth and strictly monotone dependence of power on the noncentrality ensures
         the validity of equations 20-21. The proof is completed by noting that the monotonicity
         extends the simultaneity property to the power confidence region.
      
      Figure 1 gives an example plot of approximate power confidence regions surrounding the predicted
         power curve for the rank-adjusted Huynh-Feldt test for ∊=0.720. Graphical representations such as Figure 1 help researchers accurately recognize the amount of uncertainty in their power calculation,
         and lead to better decisions about design.

      In some cases scientists prefer to consider sample size as a function of the pattern
         of mean differences. The theory already presented allows plotting sample size as a
         function of mean difference, albeit with a shift in algorithm. The power function
         must be numerically inverted to solve for the sample size desired. Taylor and Muller
         [16] outlined the steps of algorithm needed for the univariate case. Details are not presented
         here for the sake of brevity.
