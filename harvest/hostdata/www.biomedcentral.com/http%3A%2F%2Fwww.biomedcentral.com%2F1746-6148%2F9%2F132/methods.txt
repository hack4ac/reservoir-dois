Methods
   
      Sample collection and genotyping
      Blood samples were collected randomly from 590 client-owned Shiba Inu-breed dogs with
         the cooperation of their owners and veterinarians from different animal hospitals
         in Japan. These dogs were clinically unaffected for GM1 gangliosidosis. The dogs were
         native to the Japanese districts shown in Table&nbsp;1 and Figure&nbsp;1. The genotypes of the dogs were determined using real-time PCR as previously reported
         [4].
      
      Retrospective survey and pedigree analysis
      The number and the native district of the affected dogs were surveyed retrospectively
         based on the records in our laboratory, which has been exclusively supporting the
         diagnosis of this disease in Japan. Pedigree analysis was performed to elucidate the
         genetic relationships among the affected dogs and carriers identified previously and
         in the present study, as well as to deduce the pathway of transmission and distribution
         of the mutant allele. The genetic relationships among the affected dogs and carriers
         were analyzed using the pedigree records issued by the Nihon-ken Hozon-kai (http://www.nihonken-hozonkai.or.jp/ webcite) and the Japan Kennel Club (http://www.jkc.or.jp/ webcite), a kennel club certified by the Federation Cynologique Internationale (http://www.fci.be/ webcite).
      
      All the experimental procedures using animals and their specimens were performed in
         accordance with the guidelines regulating animal use and ethics issued by the Experimental
         Animals Committee at Kagoshima University.
