Abstract

Fever is prevalent in the majority of patients after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and is associated with worse outcome. Treatment of fever is highly recommended, but with low-grade evidence in current guidelines. The analysis by Schiefecker and colleagues reveals that the situation may be more complicated than at first glance and careless treatment may introduce further harm. The importance of this study lies in analyzing real-world multimodal neuromonitoring data, showing a pitfall in incautiously applied treatment paradigms.
