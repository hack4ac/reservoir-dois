Methods
   
      Collection of chicken ovary and follicle tissues
      A total of 30 one-day-old female Single Comb White Leghorn chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) were obtained from Shanghai Poultry Breeding Co Ltd and were reared in the brooding
         temperature at 35°C (65% RH) for the first 5&nbsp;days. The lighting program was 23&nbsp;h light:
         1&nbsp;h darkness. The chickens were reared under natural temperature and light (latitude:
         36°28′ N; longitude: 117°59′; June to October, 2009). All chickens received a starter
         diet with 19% crude protein and 11.97&nbsp;MJ/kg of metabolizable energy; after day 42
         they received a grower diet with 16.5% crude protein and 11.97&nbsp;MJ/kg of metabolizable
         energy. Feed and water were freely available during the rearing period.
      
      Samples were collected when the chickens were 42, 70, 90, 110 and 162&nbsp;days-old. At
         each stage, three chickens were randomly slaughtered and ovaries were collected, and
         the following follicles were collected from 162-d ovary: F1 (34&nbsp;mm), F2 (30–31&nbsp;mm),
         F4 (22–24&nbsp;mm), F6 (12–14&nbsp;mm), small yellow follicle (SF, 6–8&nbsp;mm) and large white follicle
         (LW, 2–4&nbsp;mm). Further, three whole ovaries from 42- and 162-day-old Single Comb White
         Leghorn hen were collected separately to prepare two pools representing sexually immature
         and sexually mature ovaries for constructing small RNA libraries. These tissues were
         frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA isolation.
      
      All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Ethics
         Committee of Shandong Agricultural University and performed in accordance with the
         “Guidelines for Experimental Animals” of the Ministry of Science and Technology (Beijing,
         China).
      
      Small RNA library construction and Illumina small RNA deep sequencing
      Two small RNA libraries pooled from immature ovaries (42-d) and mature ovaries (162-d)
         were constructed. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the
         manufacturer’s protocol, and the quantity of RNA was examined by using an Agilent
         2100 Bioanalyzer. From each sample, 20&nbsp;μg of total RNA was used for Solexa sequencing
         by an Illumina Genome Analyzer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) at the Beijing Genomics
         Institute (BGI) (Shenzhen, Guangzhou, China). Briefly, the 16–30 nt fraction of total
         RNA was purified and enriched using denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
         (PAGE). Then 3′ and 5′ RNA adapters were each ligated with T4 RNA ligase. Subsequently,
         the small RNAs ligated to adapters were subjected to RT-PCR amplification for 15 PCR
         cycles. The amplification products (70–90 bases in length, small RNA and adapters)
         were further purified on a 6% polyacrylamide TBE gel and used for sequencing analysis.
         Sequencing reads were extracted from the image files generated by the Illumina/Solexa
         1G Genome Analyzer.
      
      Bioinformatic analysis of sequencing data
      After filtering adaptor sequences and removal of contaminated reads, the clean reads
         were processed for computational analysis. First, the clean reads were mapped to the
         UCSC chicken genome galGal3 using NCBI MegaBLAST and rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, scRNA and
         snoRNA were discarded from the small RNA sequences. Subsequently, the remaining sequences
         were analyzed by a BLAST search against the miRNA database, miRBase (version14.0 and
         19.0) [62], to identify the conserved miRNAs in Gallus gallus. Only the perfectly matched sequences were considered to be conserved miRNAs. To
         analyze differential miRNA, miRNAs expression in each library (42-d and 162-d chicken
         ovary) was normalized to obtain the expression of transcripts per million using the
         following formula: Normalized expression = (Actual miRNA sequencing reads count /
         Total clean reads count) × 1,000,000. If the normalized expression (NE) value of a
         given miRNA is zero, the expression value was modified to 0.01. If the normalized
         expression of a given miRNA is less than 1 in both libraries, it was removed in future
         differential expression analyses. The fold-change and P-value were calculated from
         the normalized expression. When |log2Ratio| ≥ 1 and P-value ≤ 0.05, it was be seen
         as differential expression [63].
      
      Quantitative real-time PCR of miRNAs
      To validate and characterize the differentially expressed miRNAs identified using
         high-throughput sequencing, five miRNAs were selected, and we analyzed their relative
         expression levels in ovaries at 42, 70, 90, 110 and 162&nbsp;days of age as well as in
         different sized follicles. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using Mx3000p™ SYBR® Green Real-time quantitative PCR Analyzer (Stratagene, USA). Briefly, 3&nbsp;μg
         miRNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using One Step PrimeScript® miRNA cDNA Synthesis
         Kit (Tiangen Biotech Co., China). The reverse transcriptase reaction consisted of
         10&nbsp;μL 2× miRNA Reaction Buffer Mix, 2&nbsp;μL 0.1% BSA, 2&nbsp;μL miRNA PrimeScript® RT Enzyme
         Mix, 2&nbsp;μL total RNA (2&nbsp;μg/μL) and RNase-free dH2O up to 20&nbsp;μL. The RT-PCR program was 37°C for 60&nbsp;min and 85°C for 5&nbsp;sec. The cDNA
         products were stored at −20°C. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed with SYBR®
         Premix Ex Taq™ II (Tiangen Biotech Co., China). The reaction solution was prepared on ice, and the
         components were 10&nbsp;μL SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ II (2×), 0.8&nbsp;μL PCR Forward Primer (10&nbsp;μM), 0.8&nbsp;μL Uni-miR qPCR Primer (10&nbsp;μM), 0.4&nbsp;μL
         ROX Reference Dye II(50×), 3&nbsp;μL cDNA, and dH2O up to 20&nbsp;μL. The reaction mixtures were incubated in a 96-well plate at 95°C for
         30&nbsp;sec followed by 40&nbsp;cycles of 95°C for 5&nbsp;sec, 60°C for 30&nbsp;sec and 72°C for 30&nbsp;sec.
         All reactions were run in triplicate. The primers for miRNAs have the same sequences
         as Gallus gallus miRNAs with an appropriate adjustment at their 5′ terminus. The relative expression
         quantification was calculated using the 2−ΔΔCt method after the threshold cycle (Ct) and was normalized with the Ct of chicken 5S rRNA. Data are from three individuals. The each miRNA expression level
         was presented as 2−ΔΔCt means ± SE (standard error), and error bars indicate the standard error of 2−ΔΔCt mean values. One-way ANOVA and Duncan’s Multiple Range test (P &lt; 0.05) (SAS version 8.02, 2001) were used to examine the significance of differential
         expression level in each miRNA between different stages ovaries or different size
         follicles, and the difference was considered as significant when P &lt;0.05.
