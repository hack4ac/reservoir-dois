      Yeast strains and plasmids used
      The genotype and source of different yeast strains used in this study are described
         in Additional file 3: Table S1. The sup35Δ strain, Y133, was generated by transforming strain GT81 [35] with PCR-generated copies of the kanmx cassette amplified from plasmid pFA6a-KanMX6 [48] with primers containing regions homologous to the SUP35 locus (CCATTGTACTGTAACAAAAAGCGGTTTCTTCATGACTTGCTCGGcggatccccgggttaattaa and GCATTTACTTATGTTTGCAAGAAATTTACTCGGCgaattcgagctcgtttaaac,
         regions homologous to SUP35 locus indicated in capital letters).

      A plasmid containing the functional domain of Sup35, Sup35C, was cloned using primers
         CCGGCCGCGGATGGTTTGGTGGTAAAGATCACG (forward primer, Sac II site underlined) and CCGGGAGCTCTTACTCGGCAATTTTAACAATTTTACC (reverse primer, Sac I site underlined) into plasmid p2HG [49], creating plasmid p2H-SupC. The GAF519 and GAF582 regions in the open reading frames
         (ORF) encoding Q-rich domains were PCR amplified using specific primer pairs which
         amplified 248&nbsp;bp and 473&nbsp;bp products corresponding to positions 1309–1557 in GAF519
         ORF and 1270–1743 GAF582 ORF, respectively. Following primer pairs for GAF519-Q (Forward-
         CGCGGATCCTGATGCAAGGTGTGCT, Reverse- TATTATCCGCGGCTGCGGCTGCGGCTGTT) and GAF582-Q (Forward- AAGAAGGATCCATGGATGCCCAGCAA and Reverse-TATTATCCGCGGGAGAGTCTGTTGTGTTTG) were used where Bam H I in the forward and Sac II in the reverse primers are underlined. The PCR amplified products were cloned in
         frame (using Bam H I and Sac II sites) with C terminal part of Sup35 lacking the N-terminal prion-forming region
         of Sup35 in plasmid p2H-SupC with His+ selectable marker to generate p2H-GAFQ-SupC. The p2H-GAFQ-SupC plasmids (and control plasmid p2H-SupC) were transfected in the [PSI+] sup35Δ diploid yeast strain Y133 and transformants were selected at –His plates. Individual diploids were spotted on medium lacking His and replicated plated on plates with YPD and -Ade to monitor prion phenotype. In
         addition, GAF519-Q and GAF582-Q PCR products with Bam H I and Sac II restriction sites, described above, were also cloned in frame with GFP
         at the C terminus under a copper inducible promoter in the pCUP-GFP plasmid [40]. URA was used as selection marker to generate pCUP-GAFQ-GFP for visualizing GAFQ-GFP fusions using confocal microscopy. The plasmid pCUP-SUP35NM-GFP
         [40] expressing the prion domain of Sup35 fused to GFP was used as a positive control.
      
      Induction of sporulation and isolation of haploids
      The SUP35/sup35Δ diploid strain Y133, transformed with plasmids p2H-GAF519Q-SupC, p2H-GAF582Q-SupC or p2H-SupC was induced to sporulate and random haploid spores were isolated per standard yeast
         methods [50]. Single colonies were isolated and transferred onto YPD master plates which were
         then replica plated on media with G418 and also plates lacking His to confirm sup35Δ as well as the presence of p2H-GAF519Q-SupC, p2H-GAF582Q-SupC or p2H-SupC plasmids. In addition, same constructs of GAFQ-SupC fusions and SupC alone but with
         Ura as selectable marker were also used to replicate results seen with His plasmids. The mating type of individual haploids was determined following standard
         protocols [50] and haploids with deletions of endogenous SUP35 was validated by western blotting with antibody which recognize only the N-terminal
         portion of Sup35 (gift from S.Lindquist). The expression of GAFQ-SupC fusion proteins
         was confirmed with an antibody which specifically recognizes the C terminus of Sup35
         (gift from D. Bedwell). Individual haploids expressing GAF582SupC with His (MATa) and Ura (MATα) markers were used for mating to generate MATa/α diploid which were selected
         on –His –Ura plates. Sporulation was induced in these diploids using and tetrad dissection
         was performed using standard methods [50].
      
      Western blotting
      After overnight growth of cells in 5&nbsp;ml selective medium, 4&nbsp;ml culture was transferred
         to 20&nbsp;ml fresh medium and incubated at 30°C for 3&nbsp;hours. Cells were harvested by centrifuging
         at 4000&nbsp;rpm for 10&nbsp;minutes and resuspended in 200&nbsp;μl of 0.1&nbsp;M NaOH and incubated at
         room temperature for 10&nbsp;minutes. Finally cells were centrifuged at maximum speed for
         1&nbsp;minute, resuspended in SDS gel loading buffer and heated at 95°C for 5–10&nbsp;min prior
         to SDS-PAGE analysis.
      
      Curing of GAFQ-SupC nonsense suppression phenotype
      Individual yeast haploids expressing GAFQ-SupC fusions in the sup35Δ background that exhibit nonsense suppression phenotype by growth on medium lacking
         Ade were replica plated on YPD alone and YPD supplemented with 5&nbsp;mM guanidine HCl.
         Cells on YPD and YPD plus guanidine HCl were grown for 2&nbsp;days and kept at 4°C for
         2 additional days before comparing their colors. The Ade + cells were also cured by
         over-expressing Hsp104 by transforming cells with a pGPD-HSP104 plasmid (a high copy
         plasmid with constituative Hsp104 expression and Ura selectable marker). Transformants
         were confirmed to have lost Ade + phenotype by growth on medium lacking Ade and color
         assay was performed by growth on YPD plates compared to vector control cells. Cells
         cured by over-expressing Hsp104 were analyzed by western blot for expression of Hsp104
         and compared to control cells.
      
      Visualizing GFP-expressing yeast cells
      GAFQ-GFP fusions under copper inducible promoters described above were transformed
         into 74-D694 [51] strains (OT60, OT56, OT55 and GT17) described in Additional file 3: Table S1. The NM-GFP fusion under a copper inducible promoter was used as a positive
         control to visualize aggregation patterns in these strains [40]. Transformed cells were grown on -Ura plates for 3&nbsp;days at 30°C. At least 14 individual
         colonies for each construct were plated onto -Ura master plate which was replica plated
         onto YPD, YPG, and –Ade plates to monitor color pigmentation, petite phenotype and
         growth on -Ade, respectively. A single colony of each strain and construct combination
         was grown overnight in 5&nbsp;ml -Ura medium as a pre-culture. The overnight culture (100–300&nbsp;μl)
         was diluted into fresh 5&nbsp;ml -Ura medium with 150&nbsp;μM CuSO4 to induce expression of GFP constructs for 12–16&nbsp;hours. Cells were fixed by directly
         adding formaldehyde in the culture (final concentration 3.7%) and incubated for additional
         20&nbsp;minutes at room temperature. Cells were harvested by centrifuging at 5000&nbsp;rpm for
         5&nbsp;minutes 10&nbsp;ml PBS. The PBS washed cells were spun down and finally resuspended in
         buffer containing K2HPO4 (86.6&nbsp;mM), KH2PO4 (13.4&nbsp;mM) and sorbitol (300&nbsp;mM) and GFP was visualized using a Leica SP2 confocal
         microscope.
      
      Centrifugation analysis
      Total cell lysates were prepared from GuHCl treated and non-treated log phase yeast
         cells, expressing GAFQ-SupC fusions, SupC∆NM, and OT55 [PSI+] strain as described [40]. Lysates prepared in non-denaturing condition were fractionated into supernatant
         and pellet fractions as described [40] and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE followed by an immunoblot using anti-Sup35 antibody
         which only recognize C terminus of Sup35.
