      Cell culture
      SH-SY5Y cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10%
         (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and maintained in 5% (v/v) CO2/90% (v/v) humid air at 37°C. Cells were plated onto 96-well culture plates at a density
         of 1 × 104 cells/well for cytotoxicity assays or 60-mm culture dishes at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well for western blotting, RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and total SOD detection.
         After 24&nbsp;h, the culture medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM supplemented with
         0.12&nbsp;mM formaldehyde, and different concentrations of drugs were used to treat cells
         as indicated in the results.
      
      Cell viability assay
      The viability of cells was evaluated using the CCK-8 kit. Briefly, 10&nbsp;μL of the CCK-8
         solution was added to each well of the 96-well plate and left to incubate for 4&nbsp;h
         in the incubator at 37°C. According to the manufacturer, simultaneous absorbance readings
         were measured at 450 and 630&nbsp;nm using a microplate reader. The difference between
         the two readings was used in the final analysis.
      
      Cell morphology analysis
      SH-SY5Y cells (plated at 3 × 105) were grown in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in 5% (v/v) CO2/90% (v/v) humid air at 37°C. After 12&nbsp;h of plating, the culture medium was replaced
         with serum-free DMEM in the presence of 0.12&nbsp;mM formaldehyde supplemented with 100&nbsp;μM
         geniposide, 10&nbsp;μM ginsenoside Rg1 or TLJN, which consisted of 100&nbsp;μM geniposide and
         10&nbsp;μM ginsenoside Rg1. At different time intervals (6, 12, and 24&nbsp;h), cells were fixed
         with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. Hoechst33258 was applied to label the nuclei and F-actin
         was labeled with phalloidin. All images were obtained by laser scanning confocal microscopy
         (LSCM; Olympus FV1000, Tokyo, Japan).
      
      Analysis of apoptosis
      Analysis of apoptosis was carried out by flow cytometry using the annexin V apoptosis
         detection kit. Cells were harvested, counted, and resuspended in 1 x binding buffer
         at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL. The cell suspension (100&nbsp;μL) was transferred to a 5&nbsp;mL culture tube and
         5&nbsp;μL of Annexin V-FITC was added. The suspension was gently mixed and incubated for
         10&nbsp;min at room temperature in the dark. Propidium iodide (PI) was added (10&nbsp;μL) and
         samples were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
         USA) within 1&nbsp;h.
      
      Western blotting
      Western blotting was carried out as previously described 
         					[17]. SH-SY5Y cell lysates were prepared and 50 μg of protein was loaded on a 12% (w/v)
         sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel. The separated proteins were transferred
         to PVDF membrane and the membrane was hybridized with an anti-Bcl-2 monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution) or anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (1:5000
         dilution). Horse radish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit/mouse IgG was used as the
         secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution).
      
      RT-PCR analysis
      The expression of the apoptotic-related genes was detected by RT-PCR. Total RNA was
         extracted from SH-SY5Y cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The integrity of RNA
         was examined by identifying intact 18&nbsp;s and 28&nbsp;s ribosomal RNA bands upon agarose
         gel electrophoresis. The purity and quantity were estimated by measuring the absorbance
         at 260/280&nbsp;nm spectrophotometrically. RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using
         M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Transgen Inc.). Quantitative real time PCR was performed
         using TansStartTM Green qPCR SuperMix (UDG) (Transgen Inc.) according to the following
         reaction conditions: 50°C 2&nbsp;min (UDG Incubation), 95°C 10&nbsp;min (UDG Inactivation),
         40–45&nbsp;cycles: 5&nbsp;sec 95°C, 15&nbsp;sec 55°C (according to different primers), and 10&nbsp;sec
         72°C. The collected data were analyzed using Rotor-Gene 6000 Series Software 1.7 (Qiagen,
         Valencia, CA, USA). Normal RT-PCR was performed using Taq DNA Polymerase (Transgen
         Inc.) and detected by gel electrophoresis. The PCR primers were designed by Primerpremier
         5.0 software and synthesized by Shanghai Sangon Inc. (Shanghai, China). The primers
         for Bcl-2 were (TM: 55°C), forward: 5′-tgtgtggagagcgtcaacag-3′ and reverse: 5′-cagacatgcacctacccagc-3′;
         for 18&nbsp;s RNA (TM: 55°C), forward: 5′-cagccacccgagattgagca-3′ and reverse: 5′-tagtagcgacgggcggtgtg-3′;
         for P53 (TM: 60°C), forward: 5′-acagctttgaggtgcgtgttt -3′ and reverse: 5′- ccctttcttgcggagattctct-3′;
         for caspase 3 (TM: 53°C), forward: 5′-gaaattgtggaattgatgcgtga-3′ and reverse: 5′-ctacaacgatcccctctgaaaaa-3′;
         for caspase 9 (TM: 53°C), forward: 5′-cttcgtttctgcgaactaacagg-3′ and reverse: 5′-gcaccactggggtaaggttt-3′;
         for β-actin (TM: 60°C), forward: 5′-catgtacgttgctatccaggc-3′ and reverse: 5′-ctccttaatgtcacgcacgat-3′.
      
      Assay for SOD, GSHPx and catalase activity
      SH-SY5Y cells were harvested and then lysed using cell lysis solution (Beyotime Institute
         of Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China). Total protein concentration was quantified using
         the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Boston, MA, USA). The activity
         of SOD was determined using the total SOD assay kit with WST-1. The activities of
         GSHPx and catalase were determined using the cellular glutathione peroxidase assay
         kit and catalase assay kit according to the manufacturers’ instructions.
      
      Statistical analysis
      Each experiment was repeated at least three times and results were expressed as the
         mean ± standard deviation (SD). Analysis of variance was carried out using SPSS 11.0
         (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Values of P &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
