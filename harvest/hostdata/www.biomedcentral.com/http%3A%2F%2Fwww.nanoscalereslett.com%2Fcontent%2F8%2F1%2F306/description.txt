				Inverted zinc oxide photonic crystal structures were fabricated from polystyrene sphere (PSS) template using the sol–gel solution of ZnO by spin-coating method. It is easily able to control and fabricate the photonic crystal structures using the self-organized PSS with a size of 193 nm. The inverted ZnO photonic crystal structures observed show the (111) tendency of the hexagonal compact arrangement formation. The resulting structures possess the photonic band gaps in the near-ultraviolet range and exhibit an enhanced photoluminescence spectrum. The technology can effectively increase the light output intensity or efficiency for the applications of optoelectronic devices.
