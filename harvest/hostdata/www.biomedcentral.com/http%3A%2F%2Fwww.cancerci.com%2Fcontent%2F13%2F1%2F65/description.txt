						Background

					
					Folate-nanoliposomes delivery system has emerged recently as a specific and safety delivery method and gradually used as the carrier of a variety kinds of drugs including compounds, plasmids and siRNAs.

				
				
					
						Methods

					
					In this study, we established a bone marrow and bone metastasis xenograft mouse model by injecting the LA-N-5 cell into the bone marrow cavity. Fluorescence microscopy, TUNEL Assay, Quantitative RT-PCR and western blot were conducted to analysis the distribution of folate-nanoliposomes entrapped MYCN (V-myc myelocytomatosis viral related oncogene) siRNA in mice and the relevant suppression effect.

				
				
					
						Results

					
					The folate-nanoliposomes entrapped MYCN siRNA can be specifically distributed in tumor tissues. Further study shows that folate-nanoliposomes entrapped MYCN siRNA lead to MYCN mRNA expression significantly down-regulated (>50%, and p < 0.05) compared with negative control siRNA treatment. MYCN protein expression was inhibited about 60% in vivo, thus induced tumor cell apoptosis markedly.

				
				
					
						Conclusion

					
					This study point to a new way for treatment of metastatic neuroblastoma and could widen the application of folate-nanoliposomes delivery system in tumor therapy.
