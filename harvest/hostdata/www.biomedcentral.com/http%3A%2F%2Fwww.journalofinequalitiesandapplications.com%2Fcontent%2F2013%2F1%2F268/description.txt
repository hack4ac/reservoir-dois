Given a Banach space  X 
 , let  
    M 
    C 
 
 ∈ 
 B 
 ( 
 X 
 ⊕ 
 X 
 ) 
  denote the upper triangular operator matrix  
    M 
    C 
 
 = 
 
    (

             0 
 
          
             B

 , and let  
    δ 
    
       A 
       B 
 
 
 ∈ 
 B 
 ( 
 B 
 ( 
 X 
 ) 
 ) 
  denote the generalized derivation  
    δ 
    
       A 
       B 
 
 
 ( 
 X 
 ) 
 = 
 A 
 X 
 − 
 X

 . If  
    lim 
    
       n 
       →

    σ

 (

    C

 = 
 
    σ 
    x

    M

 , where  
    σ 
    x 
 
  stands for the spectrum or a distinguished part thereof (but not the point spectrum); furthermore, if  R 
 = 
 
    R

 ⊕ 
 
    R 
    2 
 
 ∈ 
 B 
 ( 
 X 
 ⊕ 
 X 
 ) 
  is a Riesz operator which commutes with  
    M 
    C 
 
 , then  
    σ 
    x 
 
 ( 
 
    M

 + 
 R 
 ) 
 = 
 
    σ 
    x 
 
 ( 
 
    M 
    C 
 
 ) 
 , where  σ  x  stands for the Fredholm essential spectrum or a distinguished part thereof. These results are applied to prove the equivalence of Browder’s ( a -Browder’s) theorem for  
    M 
    0 
 
 ,  M  C ,  
    M 
    0 
 
 + 
 R 
  and  
    M 
    C 
 
 + 
 R 
 . Sufficient conditions for the equivalence of Weyl’s ( a -Weyl’s) theorem are also considered.
