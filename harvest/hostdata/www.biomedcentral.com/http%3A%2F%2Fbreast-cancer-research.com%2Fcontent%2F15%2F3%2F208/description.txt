            Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women in the United States but significant disparities exist for African American women compared to Caucasian women. African American women present with breast cancer at a younger age and with a greater incidence under the age of 50 years, develop histologically more aggressive tumors that are at a more advanced stage at presentation, and have a worse disease-free and overall survival than Caucasian women. The biological characteristics of the primary tumor play an important role in determining the outcome of the disparity, and significant differences have been identified between African American and Caucasian breast cancer in steroid receptor and growth factor receptor content, mutations in cell cycle components, chromosomal abnormalities, and tumor suppressor and other cancer genes. The consequences of the biological factors are influenced by a variety of nonbiological factors, including socioeconomic, health care access, reproductive, and confounding factors. The nonbiological factors may act directly to enhance (or inhibit) the consequences of the biological changes, indirectly to facilitate outcome of the disparity, or as a cofounding factor, driving the association between the biological factors and the disparity. The prevention and management of the disparities will require an understanding of the relationship of biological and nonbiological factors. The present review was undertaken to promote this understanding by describing the biological basis of the four major disparities - early age of onset, more advanced stage of disease, more aggressive histologic changes, and worse survival - and the important relationship to the nonbiological factors. A model is proposed to provide a comprehensive view of this relationship, with the goal of facilitating an understanding of each disparity and the issues that need to be addressed to eliminate the disparity.
