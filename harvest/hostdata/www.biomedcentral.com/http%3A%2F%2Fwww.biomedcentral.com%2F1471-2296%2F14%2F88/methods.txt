Methods
   
      Participants and recruitment
      Participants were recruited as part of the Renal Risk in Derby (RRID) study, a prospective
         cohort study of people with CKD stage 3 in a primary care setting. The methods for
         the RRID study have been published in detail elsewhere 
         					[24]. In summary, eligible participants were 18&nbsp;years or over, met the Kidney Disease
         Outcomes Quality Initiative criteria for CKD stage 3 (estimated GFR [eGFR] of between
         30 to 59&nbsp;ml/min per 1.73&nbsp;m2 on two or more occasions at least 3&nbsp;months apart prior to recruitment), were able
         to give informed consent, and were able to attend their general practitioner (GP)
         surgery for assessments. People who had previously had a solid organ transplant or
         who were terminally ill (expected survival &lt;1&nbsp;years) were excluded. The RRID study
         is conducted by a single nephrology department, but participants were recruited directly
         from 32 GP surgeries. Eligible patients were invited to participate via a letter sent
         by their GP and telephoned the coordinating centre to schedule a study visit. Study
         visits were conducted at participating GP surgeries by the researchers.
      
      Data collection
      First study visits were conducted from August 2008 to March 2010. Screening and baseline
         visits were combined due to the large proportion of elderly participants and the logistical
         challenges associated with conducting study visits in multiple primary care centres.
         Participants were sent a medical and dietary questionnaire as well as three urine
         specimen bottles, and were asked not to eat cooked meat for at least 12&nbsp;hours before
         the assessment. Urine was collected as three early morning samples. Socioeconomic
         status (SES) was defined by two methods. First, using the Indices of Multiple Deprivation
         score (IMD); a social deprivation score comprising a composite measure of seven domains
         which demonstrates a strong relationship to health in all geographical locations 
         					[25]. Second, self-reported education status was collected; an important indicator of
         socioeconomic status in elderly populations 
         					[26]. Education status was categorised into eight groups (no formal qualifications, General
         certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) or equivalent, Advanced level (A level),
         National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) 1–3, NVQ 4–5, first degree, higher degree,
         patient refused to answer), subsequently grouped into three for the purposes of analysis
         (group one: no formal qualifications, group two: GCSE or equivalent, A level, or NVQ
         1–3, group three: first or higher degree, NVQ 4–5). Self-reported ethnicity information
         was collected, but due to the small number of non-white participants in this study,
         it was categorized into ‘White’ and ‘Other’ for the purposes of analysis.
      
      At the assessment, information on questionnaires was checked, anthropomorphic measurements
         taken, and urinalysis performed. Blood specimens were taken and the three urine specimens
         were submitted for biochemical analysis. eGFR was calculated using the modified 4-variable
         Modified Diet in Renal Disease equation and categorised into four groups (&gt;60, 45–59,
         30–44, &lt; 30) 
         					[27]. Albuminuria was defined as albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) ≥2.5&nbsp;mg/mmol in men ≥3.5&nbsp;mg/mmol
         in women in at least two of the three urine specimens (≥3&nbsp;mg/mmol in all people for
         the KDIGO guideline analyses). BMI was calculated from weight in kg divided by height
         squared in metres and categorised according to World Health Organization (WHO) categories
         underweight (&lt;18.5&nbsp;kg/m2), normal (18.5 – &lt;25&nbsp;kg/m2), overweight (25- &lt; 30&nbsp;kg/m2), and obese (&gt; = 30&nbsp;kg/m2) 
         					[28]. Central obesity was defined as a waist to hip ratio of ≥0.9 for men or ≥0.8 for
         women 
         					[29]. Diabetes was defined by having a previous clinical diagnosis in line with WHO criteria
         
         					[30]. Previous cardiovascular event was defined as subject-reported myocardial infarction,
         stroke, transient ischemic attack, revascularization, or amputation due to peripheral
         vascular disease, or aortic aneurysm. Smoking status was categorized as never smoked,
         ex-smoker, and current smoker. Self-reported alcohol consumption was categorized by
         units per week as never drinking alcohol, drinking within recommended limits (&lt;21
         units for women, &lt;28 units for men), and drinking above recommended limits. Blood
         pressure was measured after a minimum of five minutes rest in the sitting position,
         using a validated oscillometric device, recommended by the British Hypertension Society
         (Digital Blood Pressure Monitor Model UA-767, A&amp;D Instruments Ltd, Abingdon, UK).
         The same device was used for all readings. BP was calculated as the mean of three
         readings that differed by &lt;10%. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated as 1/3
         the average SBP plus 2/3 the average DBP.
      
      For the purposes of analysis, hypertension was defined as current antihypertensive
         medication, but those with a systolic BP &gt;140&nbsp;mmHg or diastolic BP &gt;90&nbsp;mmHg at baseline
         who were not on medication were also identified for descriptive purposes 
         					[31]. Target BP threshold was defined according to three clinical guidelines: the UK NICE
         guidelines BP target (&lt;140/90 or &lt;130/80 in people with diabetes and people with ACR &gt; 70&nbsp;mg/mmol),
         the US NKF KDOQI guidelines BP target (&lt;130/80 for all people with CKD), and the KDIGO
         guidelines (≤140/90 or 130/80 in people with albuminuria) 
         					[19,21,22].
      
      Participants were asked ‘Were you told that you may have an issue with your kidneys
         before you were contacted to take part in this study?’ Those answering ‘yes’ were
         defined as being aware of their CKD diagnosis. The study was approved by the Nottingham
         Research Ethics Committee 1. All participants provided written informed consent. The
         study was included on the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Clinical Research
         Portfolio (NIHR Study ID:6632) and was independently audited by QED Clinical Services
         in November 2009.
      
      Statistical analyses
      In the population of people with hypertension on antihypertensive medication, standard
         descriptive statistics were used to compare the characteristics of people achieving
         and not achieving BP control by NICE, KDOQI, and KDIGO BP targets. Univariate and
         multivariable logistic regression (adjusting for age, sex, albuminuria, diabetes,
         CVD, and eGFR) was used to identify the factors associated with achievement of the
         three BP targets. A model excluding CVD was also constructed to assess the effect
         of this variable on outcomes in view of the potential for CVD to cause lower BP through
         heart failure. Sensitivity analyses were conducted in participants whose baseline
         eGFR was &lt;60&nbsp;ml/min/1.73&nbsp;m2. The logistic regression analyses were also repeated to examine the associations
         of people achieving NICE systolic and diastolic targets separately. Interaction terms
         were introduced for gender by diabetes, age by diabetes, and diabetes by albuminuria
         because of the effect modification seen among these variables in some studies 
         					[32]. Chi squared test for trend was used to examine the degree of BP control by grade
         of albuminuria in people with and without diabetes. For people on antihypertensive
         medication or those with elevated BP identified at study registration, multivariable
         linear regression was used to investigate the association between number of antihypertensive
         medications and MAP. All odds ratios are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
         and p values &lt;0.05 are considered statistically significant. IBM SPSS Statistics for
         Windows version 19 was used to analyse the data.
