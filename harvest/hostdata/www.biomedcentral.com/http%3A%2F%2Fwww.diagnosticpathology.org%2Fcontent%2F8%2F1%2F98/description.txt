					Thymoma is a primary mediastinal neoplasm arising from or exhibiting differentiation towards thymic epithelial cells, typically with the presence of non-neoplastic lymphocytes. A 13-year-old male Mynah bird ( acridotheres tristis ) was presented for evaluation of a 2.3 × 1.5 × 1.0 cm mass in the left ventrolateral cervical region. The clinical signs, radiology, cytohistopathology and immunohistochimy findings related to the thymoma are presented. These findings indicated that the tumor was a type AB thymoma according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and veterinary classification. Thymomas are rarely reported in avian species and this is the first report in a Mynah bird.
