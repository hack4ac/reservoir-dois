            Proteins belonging to the profilin family of actin-binding proteins are considered to be important control elements for actin polymerization and have been linked to a broad spectrum of cellular functions, including cell migration. An intriguing paper recently published in  Cancer Cell unveils differential effects of profilin-1 and profilin-2, the two major isoforms of profilin, on actin cytoskeletal regulation, motility, and invasion of breast cancer cells, and further establishes a mechanism underlying profilin-2's suppressive effect on breast cancer cell migration. This viewpoint discusses the implications of these findings in the context of how profilins might regulate breast cancer cell motility.
