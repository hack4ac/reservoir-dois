      Obtaining signed GATK variant quality scores
      
      The GATK UnifiedGenotyper[19] is one of publicly available variant callers. For a sample of interest, it takes
         the sequence data (BAM) and detects SNPs by default. The outputs are summarized in
         a VCF file, which includes a list of variant positions along with the associated call
         quality scores (‘QUAL’ column in the VCF). The software can produce calls only at
         variant sites but also at any callable site regardless of confidence. We used an option
         for the latter case to obtain variant call quality for all positions of interest.
         An example of run command is as follow.
      
      java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -R human_reference.fasta -T UnifiedGenotyper -I input.bam
            –computeSLOD -L positions_of_interest.bed –output_mode EMIT_ALL_SITES -o output.vcf
      For a given list of genomic positions, we ran the GATK UnifiedGenotyper (version 1.5-3) on each tumor sample and its matched normal sample. We forced it to emit variant
         call quality for all positions. When no variant allele was found, the variant call
         quality represents a confidence level for the homozygous reference genotype. To differentiate
         such positions, we flipped the sign of the variant call quality. Therefore, a large
         negative value is a strong support for the non-existence of a variant allele, and
         a large positive value is a strong support for the existence of a variant allele.
      
      Constructing an evaluation dataset
      For method development, we aimed to construct an evaluation dataset that consists
         of a set of candidate somatic variants for which the validation status is assumed
         to be known (i.e., determined based on the gold-standard data). For LUSC patients,
         variants called based on the exome-sequence data can be validated based on the deep-sequencing
         data for 76 genes. We constructed an evaluation set using the sequence data from 39
         LUSC patients, which include an additional 23 patients. Note that the exome-seq pairs,
         the tumor RNA-seq, and the deep-sequence pairs were available for a much larger set
         of LUSC patients than the 16 patients used for the benchmark mutation-calling comparison.
      
      To build an evaluation set that includes all somatic mutations, we first detected
         variants in each tumor exome-seq data using the GATK UnifiedGenotyper[19] with a very lenient stringency level (GATK variant quality score ≥ 5):
      
      java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -R human_reference.fasta -T UnifiedGenotyper -I input.bam
            –computeSLOD -L exome_annotations.bed –output_mode EMIT_VARIANTS_ONLY -stand_call_conf
            5 -o output.vcf
      When cross-checked with the mutation-call data available for the 16 patients, all
         but three of the 5,380 mutations in the benchmark data were detected. From the 39
         LUSC patients, 8,828 variants were detected within the 76 genes (the targeted regions
         of deep-sequence data). Since we aimed to build a gold standard validation set with
         a high accuracy, we retained only the variants that have high tumor deep-seq depth
         with ≥ 100x (8,033). By requiring the tumor and the normal exome-seq depth to be ≥
         10x, and also by removing 17 ambiguous variants through manual examination, we obtained
         6,692 variants as our final set. After examining the deep-sequencing data at these
         variants (see Results), we determined the validation status. A variant is called ‘somatic’
         (334 sites; ∼ 5%) if the tumor deep-seq vaf is &gt; 10% and the normal deep-seq vaf is
         &lt; 2%, otherwise, ‘non-somatic’. An alternative criterion for a ‘somatic’ mutation
         is that the signed GATK quality scores for the tumor sample and for the normal sample
         are &gt; 200 and &lt; -100, respectively.
      
      Utilizing latent class models
      Here we provide a quick review on the latent class model assuming that mutation callers
         were developed based on independent algorithms.
      
      Suppose that K mutation-callers evaluate N positions for their mutation status (1=somatic, 0=non-somatic). Let Yi,k denote the observed outcome of the ith position by the kth caller, and Yi=(Yi,1,…,Yi,K) be the vector of outcomes over all callers for the ith position. Let Di denote the true mutation status of the ith position, and η the mutation prevalence, P(Di=1), assumed independent of i. Then, the probability of observing Yi is computed as follows:

      Note that P(Yi,k=1|Di=0) and P(Yi,k=0|Di=1) are the false positive and the false negative rates of the kth caller, respectively. Therefore, there are 1+2K parameters: the mutation prevalence η, and the false positive and the false negative rates of each of the K mutation-callers.
