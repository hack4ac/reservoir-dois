      Collection of plant
      Collection of the plant material was made in March 2011 from village Lehtrar, Tehsil
         Kotli Sattian of Pakistan. After identification a voucher specimen (# 032564) was
         deposited at the Herbarium of Pakistan Museum of Natural History, Islamabad.
      
      Preparation of extract
      Powder of dried leaves (500&nbsp;g) was extracted with 95% methanol twice (2000&nbsp;ml for
         each) for 48&nbsp;h with occasional shaking and filtered. Extract was dried at 40°C under
         reduced pressure giving a yield of 12.2% to that of the powder (Panchun Scientific
         Co., Kaohsiung, Taiwan). Extract was suspended in 50&nbsp;ml of distilled water and fractions
         were made by adding solvents (200&nbsp;ml twice) successively with increasing polarity
         i.e., n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and shake vigorously. The layers were separated accordingly and the soluble
         remainder was used as residual aqueous fraction. Fractions were dried with the yields
         n-hexane (7.5%), chloroform (3.4%), ethyl acetate (8.9%), n- butanol (7.8%) and residual aqueous fraction (10.7%) to that of the methanol extract
         [21].
      
      Phytochemical screening
      The methanol extract of M. royleanus was analyzed by LC-MS to get the fingerprint of compounds it carries and was found
         to carry number of compounds (retention time: 0.5-45&nbsp;min, m/z “mass” restriction:
         100-3200&nbsp;Da, peak height &gt; 500 counts, relative height: &gt; 2.5%, limit to largest:
         300 compounds). Dried sample of methanol extract (~15&nbsp;mg), was dissolved 1&nbsp;ml of methanol
         (15&nbsp;mg/ml). It was spun down to remove particles and 10&nbsp;μl was injected under C18
         or HILIC chromatography and positive (C18) or negative (C18/HILIC) ionization (targeting
         flavonoids and phenolic acids).
      
      Qualitative determination of the chemical constituents
      Presence of alkaloids, anthraquinones, cardiac glycosides, coumarins, flavonoids,
         saponins, phlobatannins, tannins and terpenoids in the extract and various fractions
         was confirmed individually by following standard procedures.
      
      Test for alkaloids
      Mixture of methanol extract of M. royleanus leaves and its various derived fractions (0.4&nbsp;g) in 8&nbsp;ml of 1% HCl was warmed on
         water bath. After filtration 2&nbsp;ml filtrate from the extract and each fraction was
         allowed to react with few drops of potassium mercuric iodide and with potassium bismuth,
         separately. Turbidity or precipitation formation was considered as a confirmation
         for presence of alkaloids [22].
      
      Test for saponins
      The criterion of oil emulsion formation of saponins was used for the screening of
         saponins [22]. Briefly, extract and various fractions (20&nbsp;mg) suspended in 20&nbsp;ml of distilled water
         and boiled for 5&nbsp;min. In 10&nbsp;ml of the above filtrate 5&nbsp;ml of distilled water was added
         and mixed well to develop the froth. Development of emulsion after mixing the froth
         with olive oil confirmed the existence of saponins.
      
      Test for terpenoids
      Briefly, 2&nbsp;ml of chloroform was mixed with 5&nbsp;ml (1&nbsp;mg/ml) of each sample in a test
         tube then 3&nbsp;ml of concentrated H2SO4 was added to develop the color. Exhibition of reddish brown coloration at the interface
         confirmed the presence of terpenoids [22].
      
      Test for anthraquinones
      To a volume of 6&nbsp;ml of 1% HCl, 200&nbsp;mg of each sample was added separately and boiled.
         Benzene (5&nbsp;ml) was mixed with the filtrate and after separation of benzene layer 2&nbsp;ml
         of 10% ammonia solution was lowered. Development of pink, violet or red color in the
         ammonical phase indicated the existence of anthraquinones [22].
      
      Cardiac glycosides determination
      An aliquot of 5&nbsp;ml of methanol extract of M. royleanus leaves and its various fractions (10&nbsp;mg/ml in methanol) were added in the sequence
         of glacial acetic acid (2&nbsp;ml) and FeCl3 solution (one drop). Concentrated H2SO4 (1&nbsp;ml) was added and the formation of brown ring at the interface confirmed the presence
         of cardiac glycosides [23].
      
      Test for coumarins
      In a vial having 300&nbsp;mg/ml of the extract and each fraction was plugged with filter
         paper dipped in 1&nbsp;N NaOH and boiled in a boiling water bath for few minutes. Yellow
         fluorescence of filter paper under UV light confirmed the presence of coumarins [23].
      
      Test for phlobatannins
      An amount of 80&nbsp;mg of the extract and various fractions was boiled in 1% HCl. Development
         of red precipitate indicated the existence of phlobatannins [23].
      
      Test for flavonoids
      Mixture of methanol extract and various fractions of M. royleanus leaves were prepared by adding 50&nbsp;mg of each sample to 100&nbsp;ml of distilled water
         and filtered. An aliquot of 5&nbsp;ml of dilute ammonia solution was mixed with 10&nbsp;ml of
         the filtrate. Appearance of yellow coloration by addition of few drops of concentrated
         sulfuric acid indicated the presence of flavonoid [24].
      
      Test for tannins
      A mixture was prepared by mixing 50&nbsp;mg of methanol extract and each fraction in 20&nbsp;ml
         of distilled water and boiled. Appearance of brownish green or blue-black coloration
         after mixing few drops of 0.1% FeCl3 confirmed the existence of tannins [24].
      
      Quantitative determination of the chemical constituents
      Quantification of alkaloids
      Quantification of alkaloids was performed by following the method reported previously
         (22). Each fraction (50&nbsp;mg) was mixed with 200&nbsp;ml of acetic acid (10%) in ethanol;
         the beaker was covered and incubated for 4&nbsp;h. The mixture was concentrated up to one
         third of its total volume. Ammonium hydroxide was added drop wise in the mixture until
         it formed precipitate. The precipitate was washed with ammonium hydroxide and then
         filtered. The filtrate (alkaloids) was calculated as percentage of the dried fraction.
      
      Quantification of tannins
      For quantification of tannins each fraction (50&nbsp;mg) was suspended in 100&nbsp;ml of distilled
         water, it was shaken for 1&nbsp;h in a mechanical shaker and then filtered. Each sample
         (5&nbsp;ml) was added with ferric chloride (2&nbsp;ml) in hydrochloric acid (0.1&nbsp;N) and potassium
         ferricyanide (0.008&nbsp;M). Absorbance was taken at 120&nbsp;nm within 10&nbsp;min and tannins contents
         were calculated as percentage of the dried fraction (24).
      
      Quantification of saponins
      Methanol extract and each fraction (50&nbsp;mg) were mixed in 100&nbsp;ml of ethanol (20%).

      Reagent 3: Solution A (50&nbsp;ml) and solution B (1&nbsp;ml) both were mixed in a flask.
      Reagent 4: Folin phenol reagent was added to distilled water (1:1 ratio).
      Fresh leaves (0.1&nbsp;g) were homogenized in 1&nbsp;ml of phosphate buffer (pH&nbsp;7.5). The homogenate
         was centrifuged for 10&nbsp;min at 3000&nbsp;rpm. The 0.1&nbsp;ml of supernatant was taken in a test
         tube and finally volume was raised by adding distilled water up to 1&nbsp;ml. Reagent D
         (0.1&nbsp;ml) was mixed after shaking for 10&nbsp;min. After 30&nbsp;min of incubation, absorbance
         of each sample was taken at 650&nbsp;nm and protein content was measured with help of standard
         (BSA) (23).
      
      Sugar estimation
      Fresh plant material was used to estimate the sugar content; plant material was homogenized
         and then treated with concentrated sulphuric acid. The sample was incubated for 4&nbsp;h
         at 25°C. Optical density of each sample was observed at 420&nbsp;nm (24).
      
      Total phenolic content
      Briefly, a mixture was prepared by adding 9&nbsp;ml of distilled water and 1&nbsp;ml of each
         sample. To the mixture 1&nbsp;ml of Folin-Ciocalteu’s phenol reagent was added followed
         by the addition of 10&nbsp;ml of Na2CO3 solution and total volume was made to 25&nbsp;ml by adding distilled water. The optical
         density was determined after 90&nbsp;min at 750&nbsp;nm at 23°C. Quantity of total phenolics
         was determined as mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per g of dried sample. For blank
         distilled water was used [25].
      
      Total flavonoid content
      According to this method [26], 0.3&nbsp;ml of the filtrate the extract and each fraction (50&nbsp;mg) in 10&nbsp;ml of 80% methanol

         5&nbsp;min of mixing. Total flavonoid content was calculated as mg of rutin equivalent
         per g of dried extract or fraction.
      
      In vitro antioxidant assays
      
      A stock solution (1&nbsp;mg/ml) of the methanol extract and each fraction was prepared
         in 95% methanol and diluted accordingly for various antioxidant and reducing assays.
         Antioxidant power of each assay was compared with the efficacy of standard chemicals.
      
      DPPH radical scavenging activity
      Antioxidant potential of the extract and each fraction was assessed by using 1,1-diphenyl
         1-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) assay [27]. DPPH (2.4&nbsp;mg) was dissolved in 100&nbsp;ml of methanol and diluted with methanol to obtain
         an absorbance of about 0.98 (± 0.02) at 517&nbsp;nm. An aliquot of 0.01&nbsp;ml of the extract
         and each fraction at different concentrations of 25-250&nbsp;μg/ml was added in 3&nbsp;ml of
         the DPPH solution. After incubation for 15&nbsp;min in dark; absorbance of the mixture
         was determined at 517&nbsp;nm. Following formula was applied to determine the DPPH radical
         scavenging activity;

         molybdate (4&nbsp;mM); 100&nbsp;μl of each sample was added and incubated at 95°C in a water
         bath for 90&nbsp;min. After cooling to room temperature; absorbance was recorded at 765&nbsp;nm
         against reagent blank. Total antioxidant capacity of the ascorbic acid was also estimated
         for reference. The total antioxidant capacity was determined by using following formula:
      
      
         
            
         
      
      Reducing assays
      Hydroxyl radical scavenging
      A method described earlier was adapted to assess the hydroxyl radical scavenging ability

      Hydrogen peroxide scavenging
      Methods described previously [33-35] were followed to determine the ability of extract and various fractions to scavenge
         H2O2. Hydrogen peroxide (2&nbsp;mM) working solution was made by mixing with 50&nbsp;mM phosphate
         buffer (pH&nbsp;7.4). Reaction mixture was prepared by the addition of 0.1&nbsp;ml of extract
         and each fraction with 0.4&nbsp;ml of 50&nbsp;mM phosphate buffer (pH&nbsp;7.4) followed by the addition
         of 0.6&nbsp;ml of 50&nbsp;mM H2O2 and allowed to stand for 10&nbsp;min. At 230&nbsp;nm absorbance of the mixture was recorded.
         Following equation was used to determine the capacity to scavenge H2O2;
      
      
         
            
         
      
      ABTS radical scavenging
      Method of Re et al. [36] was used for the ABTS radical scavenging activity of the extract and each fraction.
         For the development of ABTS radicals potassium persulfate (2.45&nbsp;mM) solution was mixed
         with ABTS (7 nM) and incubated overnight in the dark to get a dark colored solution.
         The standard solution of ABTS was diluted by the addition of 60% methanol to have
         an absorbance of 0.70 (± 0.02) at 745&nbsp;nm at 30°C. An aliquot of 0.3&nbsp;ml of extract
         or fraction was mixed with 1&nbsp;ml of ABTS and absorbance was recorded after one minute.

      Reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+
      Reducing capability of the extract and each fraction was estimated by following the
         method of Oyaizu [37]. A volume of 2&nbsp;ml of 0.2&nbsp;M phosphate buffer (pH&nbsp;6.6) and 2&nbsp;ml of potassium ferricyanide
         was mixed with 2&nbsp;ml of the extract and each fraction (10&nbsp;mg/ml) and incubated for
         at 50°C for 20&nbsp;min. From the reaction mixture 2&nbsp;ml was taken after the addition of
         2&nbsp;ml of 10% TCA and was mixed with 0.4&nbsp;ml of 0.1% ferric chloride and 2&nbsp;ml of distilled
         water. After 10&nbsp;min of incubation optical density of the chromogen formed was read
         at 700&nbsp;nm. High reducing power ability was associated with high absorbance values.
         Reducing power of ascorbic acid was considered as reference.
      
      In vitro anti-lipid peroxidation assay
      
      Standard method for estimation of TBARS was used to assay the degree of lipid peroxidation
         [38]. The study procedure for the animal care and experimentation was permitted by Ethical
         Committee of Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad. From freshly excised liver of rat
         10× homogenate was made in cold phosphate buffer saline (pH&nbsp;7.4). Extract and each
         fraction were added to 100&nbsp;μl of (15&nbsp;mM) ferrous sulphate followed by addition of
         3&nbsp;ml of homogenate. After incubation for 30&nbsp;min; 0.1&nbsp;ml of this reaction mixture was
         mixed with 1.5&nbsp;ml of 10% TCA. After 10&nbsp;min of incubation it was filtered and supernatant
         was added in a tube having 1.5&nbsp;ml of 0.67% TBA (in 50% acetic acid) and placed in
         a boiling water bath for 30&nbsp;min. Concentration of chromogen formed was measured at
         535&nbsp;nm. Anti-lipid peroxidation was assessed by using the following formula:
      
      
         
            
         
      
      Anti-hemolytic activity
      Anti-hemolytic activity was assessed by following the spectrophotometric method [39]. From a normal healthy individual 5&nbsp;ml of blood was taken and centrifuged at 1500&nbsp;rpm
         for 3&nbsp;min. Pellet of blood was washed three times in sterile phosphate buffer saline
         solution (pH&nbsp;7.2). The pellet was re-suspended in normal 0.5% saline solution. A volume
         of 0.5&nbsp;ml of the extract and various fractions (10, 50, 100, 200, 250&nbsp;μg/ml in saline)
         were added in 0.5&nbsp;ml of cell suspension. After incubation the mixture at 37°C for
         30&nbsp;min it was centrifuged at 1500&nbsp;rpm for 10&nbsp;min. Anti-hemolytic activity was assessed
         by measuring the absorbance at 540&nbsp;nm. For positive and negative control distilled
         water and phosphate buffer saline were used respectively. The study protocol was in
         compliance with Helsinki Declaration.
      
      Statistical analysis
      In vitro and other parametric assays were performed in triplicate and results are shown as
         mean ± SD. Antioxidant potential of different assays was determined as IC50 values by applying Graph pad prism 5-software. Statistical significance was determined
         among various treatments with one way ANOVA test. A statistical significance of P &lt; 0.05
         or P &lt; 0.01 was considered to be significant.
