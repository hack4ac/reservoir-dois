Methods
   
      Preparation and solubilization of mitochondria
      Mitochondria were isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild type strain D273-10B as described [45,46], resuspended in SIB buffer [20&nbsp;mM HEPES-KOH (pH&nbsp;7.5), 80&nbsp;mM KCl, 5&nbsp;mM MgCl2, 2&nbsp;mM potassium phosphate (pH&nbsp;7.5), 250&nbsp;mM sucrose, and 0.3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin
         (BSA, fatty acid-free)], frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until use.
         For solubilization, mitochondria pellets were resuspended to a concentration of 1&nbsp;mg
         mitochondrial protein ml-1 in either SIB buffer adjusted to pH&nbsp;8.0 or SB buffer [50&nbsp;mM Tris (pH&nbsp;8.0), 200&nbsp;mM
         NaCl]. For detergent solubilization, DDM was added to final concentrations ranging
         from 0.4 to 6.0% (w/v) as indicated. For SMA solubilization, lyophilized 3:1 SMA copolymer
         (Malvern Cosmeceutics Ltd, UK) was reconstituted as a stock of 25&nbsp;mg&nbsp;ml-1 in 50&nbsp;mM Tris (pH&nbsp;8.0) as described [25] and added to samples at final concentrations ranging from 1&nbsp;g SMA : 8&nbsp;g mitochondrial
         protein to 2&nbsp;g SMA : 1&nbsp;g mitochondrial protein as indicated. For both DDM and SMA
         solubilization, samples were incubated at 26°C for 20&nbsp;min, centrifuged (20,000 × g,
         10&nbsp;min, 4°C) and the resulting supernatants containing solubilized membrane proteins
         were collected. Further purification steps of SMA-treated samples for particular applications
         are described below.
      
      Measurement of membrane potential
      The relative membrane potential (∆ψm) of isolated mitochondria was assayed with the fluorescent potentiometric probe tetramethyl
         rhodamine methyl ester (TMRM, Molecular Probes) as described [47] using a Spex Fluorolog 3–22 spectroflorometer (Horiba Jobin-Yvon). Mitochondria were
         diluted to a concentration of 0.1&nbsp;mg&nbsp;ml-1 in SIB lacking BSA with 100 nM TMRM (quenching mode) and kinetics measurements were
         taken (λex = 547&nbsp;nm, λem = 570&nbsp;nm) with constant stirring of the sample. Prior to time course measurements,
         respiratory substrate (2.5&nbsp;mM malate and 2.5&nbsp;mM pyruvate) and 2&nbsp;mM ATP were added
         to establish a maximal ∆ψm. Subsequent additions included DDM at a final concentration of 0.4% (w/v), the SMA
         copolymer at a final concentration of 1&nbsp;g SMA : 1&nbsp;g mitochondrial protein, or an equivalent
         volume of SMA buffer only. At the end of each time course, the potassium ionophore
         valinomycin was added to a final concentration of 2.5&nbsp;μM to completely collapse the
         ∆ψm.
      
      Native gel electrophoresis and western blotting
      For BN-PAGE analysis, mitochondria were prepared as above, but resuspended in 50&nbsp;mM
         Tris (pH&nbsp;8.0) prior to DDM and SMA solubilization. 5X BN-PAGE sample buffer [50&nbsp;mM
         Trizma, 500&nbsp;mM 6-aminohexanoic acid, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) Serva Blue G] was
         added to supernatants, and 12&nbsp;μl of each sample were loaded onto 4-15% precast polyacrylamide
         Mini-Protean TGX gels (BioRad). The cathode buffer contained 190&nbsp;mM glycine, 23&nbsp;mM
         Tris (pH&nbsp;8.0) and 0.002% (w/v) Serva Blue G and the anode buffer consisted of 25&nbsp;mM
         Trizma (pH&nbsp;8.0) [33]. Following electrophoresis, gels were destained in 50% (v/v) methanol, 10% (v/v)
         glacial acetic acid and subsequently washed several times in water before visualization.
      
      For immunodetection of mitochondrial proteins, samples were resuspended in SIB and
         solubilized with DDM or SMA as indicated. Supernatants were treated with equivalent
         volumes of 2X sample buffer [140&nbsp;mM Trizma, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 4% (w/v) sodium dodecyl
         sulfate, 0.05% (w/v) bromophenol blue, 0.25&nbsp;M dithiothreitol] and resolved by electrophoresis
         on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Following transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes, Western blotting
         was performed with primary antibodies against the Sdh3 subunit of respiratory Complex
         II (Pacific Immunology) or against the Tim50 subunit of the TIM23 Complex (a gift
         from Dr. Dejana Mokranjac) and Amersham ECL Plex Cy5-conjugated secondary antibodies.
         Immunoblots were imaged on a BioRad Pharos Plus Molecular Imager using the Cy5 setting
         (635&nbsp;nm laser excitation, 695&nbsp;nm emission filter).
      
      Electron microscopy
      For TEM imaging, SMA-solubilized mitochondria were filtered (0.22&nbsp;μm) and purified
         by size exclusion chromatography on an AKTA Purifier system (GE Healthcare) using
         a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column equilibrated with 50&nbsp;mM Tris (pH&nbsp;8.0) and 200&nbsp;mM NaCl.
         Purified samples were adsorbed for 30&nbsp;sec onto carbon-coated, 400-mesh copper grids
         (Ted Pella, Inc.) made hydrophilic by glow discharge, washed with three drops of distilled
         water and stained with 1% uranyl acetate. Images were acquired using an AMT XR-40
         (2048 × 2048 pixel) camera mounted on a Tecnai Biotwin G2 Spirit transmission electron
         microscope operated at 80&nbsp;kV.
      
      Complex IV activity assays and spectrophotometric measurement of cytochromes
      Respiratory Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) activity of solubilized samples was
         determined spectrophotometrically as described [48,49]. Equine cytochrome c (Sigma) was reduced in the presence of ascorbate, purified by
         gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 column, and quantified by absorbance at 550&nbsp;nm (ϵ550nm = 27.6&nbsp;mM-1&nbsp;cm-1) [48]. To prepare samples for activity assays, mitochondria were incubated with 1% (w/v)
         DDM, with SMA at a concentration of 2&nbsp;g SMA : 1&nbsp;g mitochondrial protein, or with SMA
         buffer only (mock SMA incubation) and treated as described above. For SMA-solubilized
         and mock incubation experiments, samples were filtered through a 0.4&nbsp;μm membrane to
         remove fragmented mitochondrial particulates that could contribute to enzyme activity.
         120&nbsp;μl reaction mixtures containing assay buffer [50&nbsp;mM potassium phosphate (pH&nbsp;7.4)
         and 50&nbsp;μM EDTA] with 30&nbsp;μM reduced cytochrome c were added to a quartz cuvette (path
         length 1&nbsp;cm) and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 20&nbsp;μl of mitochondrial
         sample. Cytochrome c oxidation kinetics were monitored by the reduction of absorbance
         at 550&nbsp;nm on an Ultrospec 2100 pro spectrophotometer over 180&nbsp;s with 5&nbsp;s measurement
         intervals. Complex IV enzymatic rates were calculated from the difference in absorbance
         at 550&nbsp;nm over the linear range (first 20&nbsp;sec). For activity measurements of samples
         fractionated by gel filtration, SMA-solubilized particles were prepared as above and
         subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column equilibrated
         with assay buffer. Complex IV activity was measured as above except that 1&nbsp;ml fractions
         were measured and 30&nbsp;μM of reduced cytochrome c was added to initiate the reaction.
         In all cases, parallel reactions containing 4&nbsp;mM potassium cyanide were assayed to
         confirm specific Complex IV activity.
      
      To assay the cytochrome content of DDM- and SMA-treated mitochondria, samples were
         diluted 2X in buffer [50&nbsp;mM Tris (pH&nbsp;8.0) 200&nbsp;mM NaCl] in a 1&nbsp;ml quartz cuvette (path
         length 1&nbsp;cm) and absorbance spectra were taken from 500 to 650&nbsp;nm. Spectra of oxidized
         cytochromes of respiratory chain enzymes were recorded first, followed by spectra
         of fully reduced cytochromes in the presence of 3&nbsp;mM sodium dithionite. The difference
         spectrum (reduced – oxidized) was used to calculate the concentration of cytochrome
         a + a3 of Complex IV by the peak of the alpha absorption band (604&nbsp;nm) normalized by the
         isobestic point (630&nbsp;nm) using the differential extinction coefficient value ∆ϵ603-630nm = 24&nbsp;mM-1&nbsp;cm-1[42,43].
      
      Thin layer chromatography
      Isolated mitochondria were incubated with SMA at a concentration of 2&nbsp;g SMA : 1&nbsp;g
         mitochondrial protein as above and subjected to filtration followed by incubation
         with a chloroform, methanol and water mixture (final volume ratio of 1:2:1.6) to extract
         lipids. Extraction was carried out for 1&nbsp;h, followed by treatment with additional
         chloroform and salt (final volume ratio of 1:1:1.25). Phases were separated by low
         speed centrifugation and extracted lipids were then collected, dried down, and resuspended
         in 15&nbsp;μl of chloroform. The entire volume was then spotted onto a silica gel plate
         (Analtech). As references, 1&nbsp;μl each of POPC, POPE, and tetraoleoyl-CL (Avanti Polar
         Lipids) were also spotted. Plates were placed in a pre-equilbrated tank containing
         solvent (chloroform, ethanol, water and triethylamine at volume ratios of 30:35:4:32)
         for 1.5&nbsp;h [50] and visualized by aerospray with molybdenum blue spray reagent (Sigma) [51].
