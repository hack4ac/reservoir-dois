      Ethics statement
      The Yellow Sea Fisheries Research Institute’s animal care and use committee waived
         the need for ethical approval, as this is not required in China.
      
      Experimental animals
      Japanese flounders with an average weight of 200&nbsp;g were obtained from Haiyang Fisheries
         Company in Yantai and raised in a breeding tank with seawater (20°C). For cloning
         and tissue expression analysis, RNA was extracted from 13 tissues (brain, gill, skin,
         muscle, fin, heart, liver, spleen, eye, pituitary, kidney, head kidney, and intestine)
         from three individuals. For the bacterial challenge experiment, RNA was extracted
         from three tissues (liver, spleen, and kidney) from three individuals.
      
      Bacterial challenge
      The bacterium Vibrio anguillarum, which is pathogenic in Japanese flounders, was cultured at 28°C to mid-logarithmic
         growth on 2216E medium, centrifuged to collect the bacteria and suspended in 0.9%
         saline 
         					[21,22]. A cell counter was used to measure the number of bacteria in the suspension. A final
         concentration of 7 × 106&nbsp;cfu of V. anguillarum was used for each injection, and 0.9% saline was used as the negative control. At
         6&nbsp;h, 12&nbsp;h, 24&nbsp;h, 48&nbsp;h, 72&nbsp;h and 96&nbsp;h post-injection, three individuals from each time
         point were sacrificed and tissues were used for RNA extraction. For the negative control,
         tissues were taken 12&nbsp;h after the saline injection.
      
      RNA extraction
      Total RNA was isolated from 500&nbsp;mg powdered fish tissues by homogenization in 5&nbsp;mL
         TRIzol (Invitrogen), held at room temperature for 5&nbsp;min. An aliquot of chloroform
         (1&nbsp;mL) was added to each extract, and the resulting mixture was centrifuged (10&nbsp;min,
         13,000&nbsp;g). The aqueous layer was transferred to a clean tube, and the RNA firstly
         precipitated by the addition of 3&nbsp;mL isopropanol, and then pelleted by centrifugation
         (15&nbsp;min, 13,000&nbsp;g). The RNA pellet was washed twice with 75% ethanol and re-suspended
         in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. After DNA removal (Turbo DNA-free kit, Ambion),
         RNA integrity was detected using agarose gel electrophoresis, and the concentration
         of RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically.
      
      Cloning of PoAkirin1
      Based on the turbot Akirin1 gene sequence, primers (AKI-R-S1 and AKI-R-A1) were designed
         to amplify a conservative fragment. The 5′ and 3′ fragments of PoAkirin1 gene were
         amplified from the flounder full-length cDNA Library (a mix of liver, spleen and kidney).
      
      Sequence analysis
      Translation was performed using DNASTAR software. The conserved domain analysis and
         BLAST analysis was performed at 
         					http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi webcite, containing blastn, blastp and tblastp. The PSORT II server (http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp webcite) was used to predict the putative nuclear localization signal (NLS). The alignment
         of Akirins from different species was performed using the ClustalW alignment program,
         and the phylogenetic tree was constructed on the basis of the proportion of the amino
         acid differences (p-distances) determined by the neighbor-joining method 
         					[23] using MEGA 3 software 
         					[24]. The following proteins were used in the alignment: AAF50569 [Drosophila melanogaster], AAN12062 [D. melanogaster], ADK27484 [Scophthalmus maximus], BAI49701 [Marsupenaeus japonicus], ADK26453 [Gallus gallus], NP_001161992 [Salmo salar], ACV49724 [Oncorhynchus mykiss], ACV49723 [O. mykiss], ACV49722 [O. mykiss], ACV49721 [O. mykiss], ACV49720 [O. mykiss], ACV49719 [O. mykiss], ACV49718 [O. mykiss], ACV49717 [O. mykiss], ACV49716 [Salmo trutta], ACV49715 [S. trutta], ACV49714 [S. trutta], ACV49712 [S. trutta], ACV49710 [S. trutta], ACV49708 [S. salar], ACV49706 [S. salar], ACV49704 [S. salar], ACV49702 [S. salar], ACV49700 [Salvelinus alpinus], ACV49697 [S. alpinus], ACV49696 [S. alpinus], ADK39312 [Caligus rogercresseyi], NP_001107272 [Danio rerio], NP_001007187 [D. rerio], NP_988914 [Xenopus (Silurana) tropicalis], NP_001085484 [Xenopus laevis], NP_001025225 [Rattus norvegicus], DAA31047 [Bos taurus], DAA26175 [B. taurus], XP_002715780 [Oryctolagus cuniculus], XP_002714617 [O. cuniculus], XP_002708555 [O. cuniculus], XP_002708554 [O. cuniculus], XP_002736520 [Saccoglossus kowalevskii], AAH97074 [D. rerio], AAH03291 [Mus musculus], AAH61612 [X. tropicalis], CAM16479 [M. musculus], AAI19746 [Homo sapiens], AAH05051 [H. sapiens], NP_001103557 [B. taurus], NP_001016080 [X. tropicalis], NP_001035003 [R. norvegicus], and AEO17042 [Ovis aries].
      
      Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR)
      The RT-qPCR protocol adhered to the ‘Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative
         Real-time PCR experiment guidelines 
         					[25]. The relative mRNA steady-state level was measured by RT-qPCR. The total RNA from
         different tissues was prepared using the TRIzol reagent. The cDNA was synthesized
         from each RNA sample (500&nbsp;ng) using a PrimeScript® RT reagent kit (Takara, China),
         following manufacturer’s protocol. RT-qPCR was conducted on an Applied Biosystems
         7500 Real-Time PCR System with SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ (Takara, China). Genes encoding
         β-actin (for normal tissue types and infected kidney), a-tubulin (for infected spleen)
         and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (for infected liver) were selected for
         normalization, as their expressions have been reported to be stable 
         					[26-28]. The RT-qPCR primer pairs were designed to generate a product size of 150–250&nbsp;bp
         and a Tm of 60 ±1°C. cDNA from 13 normal and infected tissues was chosen for the detection
         of PoAkirin1, PoHEPN and PoC1q expression, using the gene-specific primers AKI-R-S1,
         AKI-R-A1 (for PoAkirin1); HEPN-R-S1, HEPN-R-A1 (for PoHEPN); and C1q-R-S1, C1q-R-A1
         (for PoC1q) (Table&nbsp;
         					1). The primers β-actin-s1, β-actin-a1, GAP-S1, GAP-A1, and TUBA-S1 and TUBA-A1 were
         used to amplify the β-actin, a-tubulin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
         fragments, respectively (Table&nbsp;
         					1). PCR efficiency (E) of these primers were between 92 and 110% and correlation coefficient
         (R2) ranged from 0.991 to 0.998.
      
      Table 1. Oligonucleotide primers used in this study
      RT-PCR was carried out with a 1&nbsp;μl cDNA sample, 10&nbsp;μl SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™, 0.4&nbsp;μl
         ROX Reference Dye II, 0.4&nbsp;μl PCR forward/reverse primers (10&nbsp;μM) and 7.8&nbsp;μl nuclease-free
         water. The thermo-cycling conditions for the reaction were as follows: 95°C for 30&nbsp;s,
         followed by 40&nbsp;cycles of 95°C for 15&nbsp;s and 61°C for 34&nbsp;s. The reaction was carried
         out with triplicate with duplicates of each sample. Data (normalized Ct values) from
         the treated and control tissues templates were compared, and the 2-ΔΔCT method was
         selected for relative quantification. All data were expressed as the mean ± S.D. and
         analyzed by one-way analysis of variance to determine significant differences between
         samples, using SPSS 16.0. Values were considered statistically significant when P &lt; 0.05
         or P &lt; 0.01.
      
      Plasmid construction
      Using the sequences of the open reading frames (ORFs) of the PoAkirin1, PoHEPN and
         PoC1q genes, primers were designed to construct pGEX4T-1-PoAkirin1 (for expression
         in E. coli), pET30a-PoHEPN (for expression in E. coli), pGBKT7-PoAkirin1 (for Yeast two-hybrid assay), pGADT7-PoAkirin1 (for Yeast two-hybrid
         assay), pGBKT7-PoC1q (for Yeast two-hybrid assay), pGADT7-PoHEPN-M1 (for Yeast two-hybrid
         assay), pGADT7-PoHEPN-M2 (for Yeast two-hybrid assay), and pGADT7-PoHEPN-M3 (for Yeast
         two-hybrid assay) vectors. The primer sequences and restriction sites corresponding
         to the vectors are shown in Table&nbsp;
         					1 and Table&nbsp;
         					2. The mutation vectors pGADT7-PoHEPN-M1, pGADT7-PoHEPN-M2, and pGADT7-PoHEPN-M3 mutation
         vectors were constructed according to the model in Figure&nbsp;
         					1.

      Yeast two-hybrid screening and mating assays
      The pGBKT7-PoAkirin1 plasmid and DNA plasmids for cDNA library clones were individually
         transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y2HGold and S. cerevisiae strain Y187, following the manufacturer's instructions in the Matchmaker™ Gold Yeast
         Two-Hybrid System User Manual. Approximately 1 × 107 library clones were screened by yeast mating with selection by growth for 3–5&nbsp;days
         at 30°C on agar media lacking Leu and Trp, but with X-α-galactosidase and Aureobasidin
         A.
      
      Recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli
      The recombinant plasmids pGEX4T-1-PoAkirin1, pET30a-PoHEPN, pGEX4T-1, and pET30a were
         transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) competent cells. After growth at 37°C, 1.0&nbsp;mM IPTG was added to the transformed
         cells and incubation continued for 4&nbsp;h. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
         electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis of total proteins was used to detect recombinant
         protein expression. No IPTG and cells transformed with pGEX-4&nbsp;T-1 or pET30a and induced
         with IPTG were used as negative controls.
      
      Western blotting analysis
      The protein concentrations of the samples were determined using an Enhanced BCA Protein
         Assay Kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China). Recombinant PoHEPN and PoAkirin1
         were serially diluted (to 5&nbsp;ng) and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a
         BioTrace NT Nitrocellulose Transfer Membrane (PALL, USA). The membranes were blocked
         and then incubated with a 1&nbsp;μg/mL dilution of the primary antibody (monoclonal antibodies
         against His or GST (glutathione-S-transferase; Uscn Life Science Inc., Wuhan, China)).
         After washing, the membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody, horseradish
         peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1,000 dilutions) (Beyotime Institute
         of Biotechnology, China). Reactive proteins were detected using chemiluminescence
         (ECL Western Blotting Analysis System, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., IL, USA).
