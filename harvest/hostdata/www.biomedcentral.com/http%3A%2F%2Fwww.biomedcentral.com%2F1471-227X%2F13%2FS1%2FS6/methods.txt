Methods
   
      Study design
      This retrospective study was carried out in a Chinese tertiary general hospital with
         3500 inpatient beds, which works as a level I trauma center. Ethical approval was
         not required. All severe trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock who were admitted
         to ED were enrolled.
      
      Medical treatments
      Upon the patients arriving in ED, emergency doctors rapidly make a preliminary assessment
         of the traumatic conditions through observing consciousness level and respiratory
         rhythm, monitoring heart rate and blood pressure, examining chest, abdomen and limb
         activity. Making a brief and accurate examination to find out and treat immediately
         the life-threatening injuries, such as respiratory obstruction, tension pneumothorax,
         bleeding and hypotension. Control active bleeding of wound on body surface by pressure
         bandage-fixing therapy.
      
      If sustained hypotension existing, doctors will determine the shock degree, estimate
         blood loss volume, and give anti-shock fluid resuscitation. The common treatments
         in our ED: Quickly open two vein channels, make a deep vein catheterization if necessary.
         Infusion rapid of 1000-1500ml balanced salt solution and 500-1000ml 706 plasma substitutes
         or Voluven in the first 20-30minutes. Give coagulation support and monitoring, such
         as transfusing packed red blood cells, fresh-frozen plasma, platelet, cryoprecipitate,
         rFVII2 and tranexamic acid to correct coagulopathy. The aim is to maintain patientsâ€™
         blood pressure around (90-80)/(60-50) mmHg before bleeding was controlled. Perfect
         preoperative examination and start damage control surgery within 1 hour if necessary.
