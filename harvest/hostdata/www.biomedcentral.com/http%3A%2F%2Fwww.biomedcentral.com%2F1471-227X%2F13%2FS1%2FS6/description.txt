                  Objective


               Uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock is a significant factor in death of severe multiple trauma patients. The acute management of injured bleeding in emergency department (ED) may improve patient outcomes. The medical records of severe multiple trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock in our ED were reviewed to summarize an evidence-based approach to the management of critically injured bleeding trauma patients.


            
               
                  Methods


               A retrospective study was carried out from January 2002 to December 2011 in a Chinese tertiary hospital. Clinical data from major trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock admitted to ED were evaluated. The patients were stratified based on the characteristics of traumatic condition and resuscitation strategies. The medical treatments and the outcomes of these severe multiple trauma patients were described.


            
               
                  Results


               A total of 1120 major trauma patients, consisting of 832 males and 288 females, were enrolled. 906 of the patients (80.9%) were injured in traffic accidents, 104 (9.3%) from falling, and 100 from other reasons. The number of injured sites varied from 2 to 6, 616(55.0%) more than 3. 902 (80.5%) trauma patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital.


            
               
                  Conclusions


               Uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock is a main reason of trauma patientsâ€™ death. The resuscitation strategy should center upon permissive hypotension and early hemostatic resuscitation combined identified and corrects coagulopathy. The current approach to the management of critically injured bleeding trauma patients is able to improve patient outcomes.
