						Background

					The ubiquitous oxazoles have attracted more and more attention in both industrial and academic fields for decades. This interest arises from the fact that a variety of natural and synthetic compounds which contain the oxazole substructure exhibit significant biological activities and antiviral properties. Although various synthetic methodologies for synthesis of oxazols have been reported, the development of milder and more general procedure to access oxazoles is still desirable.

				
				
					
						Results

					In this manuscript, a novel method for synthesis of polysubstituted oxazoles was developed from metal-free decarboxylative cyclization of easily available primary α-amino acids with 2-bromoacetophenones.

				
				
					
						Conclusions

					The method was simple, and this reaction could be carried out smoothly under mild and metal-free conditions. By virtue of this method, various polysubstituted oxazoles were obtained from the primary α-amino acids with moderate yields.
