      Plant materials
      Selection of plant species screened in this study was based on their uses in Egyptian
         traditional medicine (Table&nbsp;1). Information was gleaned from different sources of old Arabic literature available
         which are believed to be the main references used in the “Attarin” shops in Cairo.
         In this study we reviewed the information given by some scholars like Dawood el Antaki
         [11], Al-torkmany [12], Ibn Sina [13], and Ibn el-Bitar [14].
      
      Table 1. Egyptian herbal medicines reported for treatment of age- related diseases
      Plant materials (leaves, roots and seeds) were collected from either their natural
         habitats or the local market (Table&nbsp;1). Two plants Boswellia scara (supplied and identified by Dr. A. al_Adawi, Ghadafan Agriculture Research Station,
         Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Sohar, Sultanate of Oman), and Ferula assafoetida (supplied by Dr. M. Ziaratnia, Research Institute of Food Science and Technology,
         Isfahan, Iran). Voucher specimens (Table&nbsp;1) were identified by Prof. Ibrahim El-garf, a co-author of this article, and deposited
         in the Department of Phytochemistry, National Research Centre, Egypt. The collected
         fresh materials were dried, powdered and extracted by homogenization with methanol
         (10&nbsp;ml&nbsp;g−1), using electrical blender and macerated overnight then filtrated, the residues were
         re-extracted three times with fresh solvent. The filtrates were combined and the solvent
         removed at 45°C under reduced pressure. The total extracts were kept at ~ −5°C for
         further use.
      
      The multi-well plate AChE inhibition assay
      The AChE inhibitory activity of each extract was tested using 96 well micro-plate
         assay based on previously published methods [15,16] with minor modifications. Each extract (25&nbsp;μl of 10× of final concentrations in DMSO)
         was dispensed in duplicates onto 96 well micro-plate and mixed with 200&nbsp;μl of Ellman’s
         mixture containing 10&nbsp;mM Tris–HCl, pH&nbsp;8, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, fraction
         V), 1.5&nbsp;mM acetylthiocholine iodide (ATCI, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) and 3&nbsp;mM 5,5'-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic
         acid) (DTNB, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany). The control wells contained the extract vehicle
         (DMSO) instead of the extract. The reaction was started with the addition of enzyme
         solution (25&nbsp;μl, 0.1 U/ml). Autohydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by replacing
         the enzyme with 25&nbsp;μl of enzyme buffer (10&nbsp;mM Tris–HCl, pH&nbsp;8, containing 0.1% BSA)
         in duplicate wells. The enzymatic activity was monitored kinetically at 450&nbsp;nm every
         30&nbsp;s intervals for 3&nbsp;min at 30°C (linear reaction). The enzyme rate was calculated
         from the slope of the curve of absorbance change vs time. As screening strategy, final
         concentration of 1000&nbsp;μg/ml from each extract was examined and the average % inhibition
         was calculated relative to the enzyme rate at the vehicle control wells according
         to equation 1:

      Equation 1. Calculation of the average % inhibition of different extracts on AChE.
      Five serial dilutions were prepared from the extracts that showed more than 50% inhibition
         to determine the IC50 (extract concentration producing 50% inhibition of AChE activity as generated by
         non-linear regression analysis). Galanthamine (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) served as positive
         control.
      
      Determination of the inhibition type of plant extracts on AChE
      The type of inhibition of AChE by P. harmala and A. vasica extracts (reversible or irreversible inhibition) was determined by measuring the
         restored AChE activity by 10 time dilution of plant extract concentration after mixing
         and incubation of AChE and plant extract. AChE activity was measured after gentle
         mixing of 110&nbsp;μl of (100&nbsp;μl enzyme:10&nbsp;μl plant extract) with 890&nbsp;μl of mixture containing
         10&nbsp;mM Tris–HCl, pH&nbsp;8, 0.1% BSA, 1.5&nbsp;mM ATCI, 3&nbsp;mM DTNB and 90&nbsp;μl plant extract. In
         a separate experiment, the dilution effect of plant extract on AChE activity was measured
         after gentle mixing 110&nbsp;μl of (100&nbsp;μl enzyme:10&nbsp;μl plant extract) with 890&nbsp;μl of the
         same above mixture except that 90&nbsp;μl plant extract was replaced with 90&nbsp;μl DMSO (solvent).
         In reversible inhibition, AChE activity can be restored by dilution of plant extract,
         while there is no change in AChE activity with dilution of plant extract in irreversible
         inhibition.
      
      Cyclooxygenase-1 assay
      Inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis by the plant extracts was investigated using
         COX-1 assay [17]. Indomethacin was included as a standard. Per cent inhibition of plant extracts was
         calculated by comparing the amount of radioactivity present in the sample with that
         in the solvent blank.
      
      Antioxidant activity: 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay
      Plant extracts/compounds were prepared in DMSO as 10× stocks from each test concentration
         (between 0–100&nbsp;μg/ml) and briefly sonicated when necessary in an ultrasonic water
         bath. Plant extracts/compounds producing radical scavenging activities equal to or
         higher than 50% at 100&nbsp;μg/ml in a preliminary screen were further tested and EC50 (concentration of the extract/compound producing 50% scavenging of DPPH radicals)
         determined using non-linear regression analysis of the dose-%AA relationship (Equation
         1). Three reference radical scavengers (quercetin, gallic acid and t-butylhydroquinone) were tested in the assay as positive controls. The assay method
         used in the present study was based on a modified procedure [18] which is based essentially on previously published literature [19]. The plant extract/compound stock solutions (20&nbsp;μl/well) were dispensed in duplicates
         onto 96-well plates (flat-bottomed, Greiner bio one, Belgium). The assay was started
         with the addition of DPPH reagent (0.004% wt/v in methanol, 180&nbsp;μl/well). Appropriate
         blanks were prepared using the solvent only in addition to the same amount of DPPH
         reagent to get rid of any inherent solvent activity. Negative controls were also run
         in parallel to correct for any non-DPPH absorbance by coloured extracts at the test
         wavelength. The plate was immediately shaken for 30&nbsp;seconds and incubated in the dark
         for 30&nbsp;minutes at room temperature. The remaining DPPH was measured in the microplate
         reader at 540&nbsp;nm. The percentage of antioxidant activity (%AA) was calculated according to equation 2:
