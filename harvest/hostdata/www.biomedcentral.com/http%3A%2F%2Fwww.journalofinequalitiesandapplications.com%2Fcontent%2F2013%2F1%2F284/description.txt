Abstract
In this paper, we introduce new concepts of  ( 
 α 
 , 
 β 
 , 
 γ 
 ) 
 -exceptional family of elements and  ( 
 α 
 , 
 γ 
 ) 
 -exceptional family of elements for the set-valued implicit complementarity problems in  
    R 
    n 
 
  and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, respectively. By utilizing these notions and the Leray-Schauder type fixed point theorem, we study the feasibility and strict feasibility of the set-valued implicit complementarity problems. Our results generalize some corresponding previously known results in the literature.
