Methods
   
      Bacterial selected strains, culture media, growth conditions and isolation of mycobacteria
         genomic DNA
      
      Sixty-one M. tuberculosis clinical isolates were used in this work. The 61 isolates comprised 17 Beijing and
         44 non-Beijing strains. Among the 17 Beijing strains 8 (NHN5, HM77, HM903, HM764,
         990172, W4, N4 and CAM22) from Europe were previously selected as representative of
         this genotype using several typing methods. These 8 strains were selected as they
         share 80% or more of identity with Beijing strains from Shanghai area, China. The
         rest of the strains, each representing a different cluster, were selected for their
         high number copies of IS6110 (ten or more) and were collected from Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet (HMS),
         Hospital Clínico Universitario Lozano-Blesa (HCU) from Zaragoza and Hospital General
         San Jorge from Huesca (Spain). Finally, M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. tuberculosis GC1237 were used as control strains. An internal control, HMS 1301, was included
         in the study as its IS6110-RFLP is identical to GC1237 control strain. Mycobacterial strains were grown at 37°C
         in Middlebrook 7H9 broth supplemented with ADC and 0.05% Tween 80. More information
         of the clinical isolates used in this work is included in Additional file 1: Table S1.
      
      Isolation of genomic DNA
      Genomic DNA of mycobacterial strains was isolated using the CTAB method as previously
         described by van Soolingen et al. [47].
      
      Localization of the copies of IS6110 insertion sequence in the eight Beijing strains selected as representative strains
         of this genotype
      
      The first step of this work was to localize copies of IS6110 in the 8 representative Beijing strains by two methods, both based on PCR. A first
         research was conducted by Ligation-mediated PCR (LMPCR) as previously described by
         Prod’hom et al. [48]. Briefly, genomic DNA was digested with SalI enzyme and the digestions were then subjected to PCR with ISA1 or ISA3 specific
         primers for IS6110 directed outwards [45] and the common linker primer SALGD (Additional file 1: Table S2). PCR products were purified using GFX PCR DNA gel band purification kit
         (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the restriction enzyme ExoSAP-IT® (Affymetrix). The
         amplified products were sequenced with the corresponding oligonucleotides and when
         a match was found, additional primers (Additional file 1: Table S2) were designed and used with the 8 strains to verify whether the point
         of insertion was present in other of the 8 strains. These primers amplify the completed
         sequence of IS6110 and approximately 300&nbsp;bp of both flanking sequences (Additional file 1: Table S2).
      
      Secondly, PCRs were performed with specific primers (Additional file 1: Table S2), designed in a previous study for amplifying the locations of IS6110 in 210, W [31] and GC1237 strains [10]. PCRs were carried out in a total volume of 25 μl, containing 50&nbsp;ng of DNA, 2.5 μl
         of 10x PCR buffer, 200 μM dNTPs, 12.5 pmol of each primer and 1 U Taq Gold polymerase
         (Roche). Before the amplification, the template was initially denatured by incubation
         at 94°C for 9&nbsp;min then the amplification was performed for 35&nbsp;cycles of 94°C for 30&nbsp;s,
         corresponding annealing temperature for 30&nbsp;s, and 72°C for 1 to 2&nbsp;min depending on
         the amplified product. After the last cycle, the samples were incubated at 72°C for
         10&nbsp;min.
      
      The genomes of H37Rv and GC1237 were used as control in both cases.
      Sequence analysis of points of insertion of IS6110 in the DNA database and in the available literature
      
      The points of insertion of IS6110 of the reference sequenced strains: Beijing (210, 02_1987, 94_M4241A, HN878, R1207,
         T85, X-122, W and W-148 ) and non-Beijing (98-R604 INH-RIF-EM, BTB05-552, BTB05-559,
         C, CDC1551, CDC1551A, CPHL_A, EAS054, F11, GM 1503, K85, KZN 605, KZN R506, KZN V2475,
         KZN 1435, KZN 4207, NCGM 2209, str.Haarlem, S96-129, SUMu001, SUMu002, SUMu003, SUMu004,
         SUMu005, SUMu006, SUMu007, SUMu008, SUMu009, SUMu010, SUMu011, SUMu012, T17, T46 and
         T92) were obtained comparing the flanking regions of each IS6110 in the genome sequences with the reference strain H37Rv using NCBI genetic sequence
         database (GeneBank) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/166 webcite).
      
      Moreover, available literature was analyzed to identify any further point of insertion
         of this sequence not described in the DNA database [10,11,13,16-18,22-24,27-35].
      
      After this sequence analysis, when a point of insertion of IS6110 of a Beijing strain (of GeneBank or available literature) was found outside of the
         amplified regions of our primer collection, additional primers were designed and included
         in the collection (Additional file 1: Table S2). In addition, flanking primers of DK regions [28] were designed to detect whether these frequent locations of IS6110 in LCS were also present in the HCS selected in this study. Moreover, the primers
         designed for the study of locations of IS6110 in clinical isolates of M. bovis with human host [22] were also included to study whether preferred locations of IS6110 in these M. bovis strains were also present in the selected M. tuberculosis strains.
      
      Localization and analysis of copies of IS6110 in the sixty-one selected clinical isolates
      
      The localization of copies of IS6110 in the 61 clinical isolates was carried out by PCR as previously describe in this
         work with all the pairs of oligonucleotides of the generated primer collection (Additional
         file 1: Table S2). H37Rv and GC1237 were used as external controls and HMS 1301 as internal
         control as this strain presents the same IS6110-RFLP as GC1237. The 8 representative Beijing strains studied before in this work
         by LMPCR and specific PCR were again included in this part of the study. The PCR products
         which might include an IS6110 were sequenced with IS61 and IS62 primers (Additional file 1: Table S2).
      
      Determination of direct repeats (DR) and analysis of the flanking regions of each
         copy of IS6110 in the genomes
      
      The DRs generated by the mechanism of the transposition of IS6110 were determined with the sequence analysis of the flanking regions of each copy of
         IS6110 in the genomes.
      
      Dendrogram based on the points of insertion of IS6110
      The informatic analysis of spoligotyping results is carried out by Bionumerics program
         and is based in presence/absence or numerical analysis 1/0 of a specific sequence
         of M. tuberculosis. Based on this idea, all the obtained IS-locations were arranged in columns on an
         excel sheet and the 61 strains (also the two controls GC1237 and H37Rv) were arranged
         in rows. When a strain presented a point of insertion, it was given the number 1 and
         if not, it was assigned the number 0. After that, the data was introduced in SpolDB4
         database as a new informatic event, included to the IS6110-RFLP and the spoligotyping of each strain and analyzed by Bionumerics program.
