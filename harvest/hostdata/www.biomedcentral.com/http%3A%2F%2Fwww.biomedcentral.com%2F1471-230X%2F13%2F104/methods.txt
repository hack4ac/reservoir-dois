Methods
   
      Study population
      This is a cross-sectional nationwide multicentre study of adult subjects aged 16 years
         or older who visited healthcare centers for routine health check-up between January
         and December 2011 in South Korea. The subjects were enrolled prospectively in 2011
         under a predefined protocol. The institutions participating in this study were healthcare
         centers located in Seoul and in the seven provinces of South Korea.
      
      Informed consent was obtained from each subject. All subjects were invited to answer
         the questionnaire which was the same as previous study’s [9] under the supervision of a well-trained interviewer. The questionnaire included information
         regarding demographic data (i.e. age, sex, and residence), socioeconomic data (i.e.
         monthly income and education level), medical history (such as H. pylori eradication therapy, history of gastric operation, and family history of gastric
         cancer (GC)), and upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (such as indigestion, bloating,
         epigastric soreness, regurgitation, or heartburn), that persisted for at least one
         month within the last 3 years.
      
      Subjects were categorized into 3 education levels: low (middle school graduate or
         less), middle (high school graduate or university dropout), and high (university graduate
         or graduate of a postgraduate course). Monthly family income was classed as 3 groups:
         low household income (&lt; US $ 3,000 per month), middle income (US $ 3,000 to 10,000
         per month), and high income (&gt; US $ 10,000 per month).
      
      Clinical and laboratory evaluations
      Anthropometric measurements (weight and height) were done by trained nurses using
         a standardized protocol.
      
      Blood samples were obtained from the antecubital vein in the morning after overnight
         fasting, and serum samples were separated after centrifugation. Serum cholesterol,
         triglyceride, and fasting glucose were measured by an automatic analyser, Alisei®
         (Seac, Pomezia, Italy). To compare these results according to seropositivity of H. Pylori, we categorized the level of total cholesterol (TC) as normal (≤240 mg/dl) and abnormal
         (&gt;240 mg/dl), trigryceride (TG) as ≤150 mg/dl and &gt;150 mg/dl, and fasting glucose
         as ≤100 mg/dl and &gt;100 mg/dl, respectively.
      
      Anti-H. pylori IgG was measured using H. pylori-EIA-Well in Healthcare System Gangnam Center and Genedia H. pylori ELISA at the remaining centers using the same kits as those in the previous studies
         [9,10]. Genedia H. pylori ELISA, developed from Korean H. pylori strains showed a sensitivity of 97.8% and a specificity of 92% [11]. H. pylori-EIA-Well showed a sensitivity of 95.6% and a specificity of 97.8% when Genedia H. pylori ELISA was used as the gold standard [9].
      
      Statistical analysis
      Evaluation of risk factors of each group according to eradication of H. pylori
      Demographic and clinical information were summarized by descriptive statistics. To
         investigate risk factors for H. pylori seropositivity and influential factors having a history of H. pylori eradication, multivariable logistic regression was used. A significance level of
         p &lt; 0.05 was used for all analyses.
      
      Comparison of trends of seroprevalence of H. pylori in 1998, 2005, and 2011
      Trends of seroprevalence of H. pylori were compared using the published data of 1998 [10] and 2005 [9]. For this comparison, study subjects in each time period were restricted to asymptomatic
         subjects without a history of H. pylori eradication and gastric operation. For statistical comparison of trends of seroprevalence
         of H. pylori in 1998, 2005, and 2011, the Cochrane-Armitage trend test, which is a modified Pearson
         chi-square test to examine the association between a binary outcome and a variable
         with multiple categories with order, was conducted.
      
      Analysis of cohort effects
      In addition, the seroprevalence of H. pylori by birth cohort group was also drawn. To examine birth cohort effects, we created
         synthetic cohorts from the successive cross-sectional data of 1998, 2005, and 2011.
         For this analysis, relevant raw data in 1998 and 2005 were obtained from the authors
         and reconstructed for the analysis of birth cohort. Data from 1998 was considered
         to be those in 1999 because the successive cross-sectional data should span with same
         interval. The interval of three cross-sectional data was 6 years. The aggregate birth
         cohort from 1930 to 1972 was restructured into 8 groups using the standard approach
         for cohort analysis [12]. In detail, a birth cohort was obtained by subtracting age from year (i.e. Birth
         cohort of 1974.5 (birth cohort of 1972–77) = Year of 1998 – Age of 24.5 (22–27 years
         old)). For example, people aged 22–27 years in 1998 (considered as data in 1999),
         those aged 28–33 years in 2005, and those aged 34–39 years in 2011 were considered
         to be in the same birth cohort, born between 1972 and 1977. Using this approach for
         other age groups in each year, eight birth cohorts (1972–77, 1966–71, 1960–65, 1954–59,
         1948–53, 1942–47,1936-41,1930-35) had three estimates of H. pylori seroprevalence at 6 year intervals for 12 years.
      
      Ethics statement
      The protocol of this study was approved by the main Institutional Review Board of
         Seoul National University Hospital (IRB No. H-1011-038-339).
