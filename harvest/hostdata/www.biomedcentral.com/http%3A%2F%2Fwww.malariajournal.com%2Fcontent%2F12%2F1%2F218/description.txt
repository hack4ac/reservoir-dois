				Malaria is a major public health problem in Ethiopia.  Plasmodium falciparum  and  Plasmodium vivax  co-exist and malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDTs) is vital in rendering parasite-confirmed treatment especially in areas where microscopy from 2008 to 2010 is not available. CareStart TM  Malaria Pf/Pv combo test was evaluated compared to microscopy in Butajira area, south-central Ethiopia. This RDT detects histidine-rich protein-2 (HRP2) found in  P. falciparum , and  Plasmodium  enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) for diagnosis of  P. vivax . The standard for the reporting of diagnostic accuracy studies was complied. Among 2,394 participants enrolled, 10.9% (n=87) were  Plasmodium  infected (household survey) and 24.5% (n=392) health facility-based using microscopy. In the household surveys, the highest positivity was caused by  P. vivax  (83.9%, n=73),  P. falciparum  (15.0%, n=13), and the rest due to mixed infections of both (1.1%, n=1). In health facility,  P. vivax  caused 78.6% (n=308),  P. falciparum  caused 20.4% (n=80), and the rest caused by mixed infections 1.0% (n=4). RDT missed 9.1% (n=8) in household and 4.3% (n=17) in health facility-based surveys among  Plasmodium  positive confirmed by microscopy while 3.3% (n=24) in household and 17.2% (n=208) in health facility-based surveys were detected false positive. RDT showed agreement with microscopy in detecting 79 positives in household surveys (n=796) and 375 positives in health centre survey (n=1,598).
RDT performance varied in both survey settings, lowest PPV (64.3%) for  Plasmodium  and  P. falciparum  (77.2%) in health centres; and  Plasmodium  (76.7%) and  P. falciparum  (87.5%) in household surveys. NPV was low in  P. vivax  in health centres (77.2%) and household (87.5%) surveys. Seasonally varying RDT precision of as low as 14.3% PPV (Dec. 2009), and 38.5% NPV (Nov. 2008) in health centre surveys; and 40-63.6% PPV was observed in household surveys. But the influence of age and parasite density on RDT performance was not ascertained. Establishing quality control of malaria RDT in the health system in areas with low endemic and where  P. falciparum  and  P. vivax  co-exist is recommendable. CareStart TM  RDT might be employed for epidemiological studies that require interpreting the results cautiously. Future RDT field evaluation against microscopy should be PCR corrected.
