Abstract
This paper discusses a more general contractive condition for a class of extended 2-cyclic self-mappings on the union of a finite number of subsets of a metric space which are allowed to have a finite number of successive images in the same subsets of its domain. If the space is uniformly convex and the subsets are nonempty, closed and convex, then all the iterations converge to a unique closed limiting finite sequence, which contains the best proximity points of adjacent subsets, and reduce to a unique fixed point if all such subsets intersect.
