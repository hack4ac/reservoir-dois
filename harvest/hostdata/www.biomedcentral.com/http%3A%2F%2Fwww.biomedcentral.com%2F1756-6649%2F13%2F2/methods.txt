Methods
   
      The impact of the registration uncertainty on the accumulated dose, and its estimated
         response, can be studied by adding known uncertainties to the registrations used in
         mapping the deformations. The simulations mimic a clinical workflow where a “plan
         of the day” is tailored to the actual position of the CTV for the individual fractions.
         The total accumulated effect, i.e. the estimated response for the dose mapped from
         all fractions to a fixed reference geometry is scored for various degree of registration
         uncertainties. As we are specifically interested in the effects of the registration
         uncertainty we assume that the patient is imaged and setup without errors at each
         fraction. According to the van Herk margin scheme [14] this means that we simulate a situation yielding only the random contribution from
         DIR based dose mapping to the CTV to PTV margin. In a real clinical situation also
         other sources of uncertainty must be considered. In section A we describe the simulation
         framework and the modelling of the image registration uncertainty, and in section
         B we apply the uncertainty model to a hypofractionated prostate treatment with spot
         scanned protons.
      
      A. Simulation of a fractionated treatment with dose mapping uncertainties
      A “plan of the day” is prepared for each of the N treatment fractions, and the fraction dose is mapped to a reference (fixed) image
         set IF for evaluation of the cumulative radiation effect, see Figure&nbsp;1. For each fraction i a moving image set

      Figure 1. Simulated clinical workflow. The flow chart to the right shows how the clinical workflow, listed to the left,
         is simulated. The fraction dose is calculated on a randomly deformed virtual patient
         model for which the exact image registration to the fixed geometry IF is known. A registration uncertainty can be added (the red part of the flow chart),
         before the dose is mapped to IF where the radiation effect is accumulated.

             will vary from fraction to fraction because of organ motion and the “plan of the
         day” approach. We adopt a view where we with a given uncertainty can track the position
         of a tissue element at all treatments and accumulate the radiobiological effect fraction
         by fraction. The DF(r) then becomes a stochastic quantity.
      
      The resulting radiobiological effect was modelled based on the LQ-model [15]. The 4D dose distribution is thereby converted into a 3D equivalent fraction dose

             Registration algorithms apply various regularisation techniques to produce a well
         behaved and physically realistic transformation. Clearly, there is a local correlation
         of the error for points close together whereas for points further apart the error
         will be more uncorrelated. In modelling of 
            
               
                  T
                  e
                  
                     i
                  
               
             this is mimicked by sampling uncorrelated errors at a sparse grid of control points
         which by means of a 3D cubic B-Spline interpolation is applied to the denser dose
         grid. The registration deviation amplitudes is sampled at the control points, independently
         for each coordinate according to a multinormal distribution with zero mean and standard
         deviation σe. A low resolution of the control points will produce a slowly varying vector field
         and thus mimic a high degree of regularisation and vice versa for a high resolution
         of the control points.
      
      Registration algorithms are often validated using landmarks where the distances between
         known displacements of the landmarks and those calculated by the algorithm, which
         in our case is equivalent to the absolute registration error

      B. Application of the simulation framework to a virtual prostate patient
      The virtual patient model
      The framework described in section A require a patient geometry, 
            
               
                  I
                  M
                  
                     i
                  
               
            , and its deformation for every fraction 
            
               
                  T
                  0

            . A single patient instance is defined as a patient with a unique geometry per fraction.
         In the simulation we used ten different patient instances for evaluation of each parameter
         combination. A male pelvic virtual patient was for this purpose constructed from average
         data for 15 prostate patients treated in the supine position, see Figure&nbsp;2. The prostate was modelled as a sphere with radius rCTV = 2.5 cm located at 20 cm depth and the bladder as an ellipsoid with radii 3.0 cm,
         4.0 cm and 2.5 cm in the lateral, superior-inferior and axial directions, respectively,
         with a concave intrusion from the presence of the prostate. The rectum was modelled
         by a curved cylinder with outer radius 1.4 cm and length 10.0 cm with wall thickness
         0.4 cm [23]. Other anatomical details, such as the femoral heads, were not included since they
         are in principle uncorrelated with the image registration dose mapping effects for
         the prostate, bladder and rectum regions.

         (a) 3D view of the virtual patient with the centre of the CTV at the origin. The black
         arrows indicate the direction of the two incident scanned proton beams. (b) A slice at x = 0.0 cm of the virtual patient in which the prostate CTV has moved
         0.5 cm versus the reference in (a) in the negative y-direction (Anterior-Posterior) causing an intrusion into the bladder
         and an expansion of the rectum. (c) The CTV has moved 0.5 cm in the positive y-direction compressing the rectum and
         decreasing the bladder intrusion.
      
      The prostate is assumed to be incompressible and change location (but not shape) as
         the rectum and bladder change filling and shape. In prostate radiotherapy treatment
         it is common to also irradiate the lower parts of the seminal vesicles to the same
         dose as the prostate. The combined volume, prostate and lower parts of the vesicles,
         will constitute a rather convex volume which we for simplicity model as a sphere shaped
         CTV. We sample the displacement of the prostate centre for each fraction,

             according to a multinormal distribution with the standard deviations 0.4, 0.1 and
         0.4 cm in the anterior-posterior, lateral and superior-inferior directions, respectively,
         consistent with the literature [24]. The fixed geometry IF, into which the radiation effect is accumulated, is simply chosen to be the one with
         zero displacement of the prostate, cf. Figure&nbsp;2a.
      
      A simple tissue deformation model was used to construct the true moving geometry

         in equation (6). The model does not assume anything about the reasons why the prostate
         has moved, i.e. the motion can be seen as a consequence of the filling in the rectum
         or the bladder.

         0.5 cm. Inside the prostate, i.e. |r| &lt; rCTV, the displacement is constant. Outside the CTV, i.e. |r| &gt; rCTV, the displacement decreases exponentially and vanishes far from the prostate
      
      The dose grid resolution was set to 0.1 cm while two different grid sizes, 1.0 cm
         and 3.0 cm, was used for the control points in the registration error. Analysis of
         all T(i)(r), i.e. the patient model and the registration error, showed values of the Jacobian
         determinant, J(T(i)(r), r), in the interval [0.4, 2.0] for the lower resolution indicating an inverse consistent
         transform without folds or tears since J &gt; 0. The T(i)(r) produced using the higher control point resolution included small regions with negative
         values of the J for 
            
               σ
            e ≥ 0.5 cm indicating a transform that is not well regularised. It is desirable that
         the accumulated dose is independent of the choice of reference image IF and this requires that J &gt; 0, which is not in general guaranteed by registration algorithms. The resulting
         dose mapping uncertainty was very similar for both resolutions but slightly more sensitive
         with respect to the image registration uncertainty for the 3.0 cm resolution. We have
         therefore concentrated on results for the 3.0 cm resolution.
      
      Generation of treatment plans for simulation
      The simulated treatments were assumed to be delivered with two opposed, scanned proton
         beams, indicated by the arrows in Figure&nbsp;2a, aiming for a homogenous target dose.
      
      The PTV was constructed by adding a margin m isotropically around the CTV.
      
      Clinically relevant planning objectives were chosen from literature values for intermediate
         risk patients for radiobiological evaluation of the prostate [25], see Table&nbsp;1, to optimise the spot weights and thus shape the proton dose distribution. Additionally,
         an artificial OAR was created as a spherical shell around the PTV to suppress the
         normal tissue dose. The target dose prescription was chosen to give a TCP of 80% since
         the TCP curve is steep at that dose level and thus the TCP should be susceptible to
         dose mapping uncertainties. However, because of the suggested low α/β there is a trend towards applying hypofractionated treatments, see e.g. Ritter [26]. Therefore, an aggressive hypofractionation scheme of 6.7 Gy × 5fx still aiming for
         a TCP of 80% were chosen with the OAR planning objectives from Isacsson et al.[27] scaled with the new prescription dose. Zavgorodni [28] noted that it might be important to take the variable fraction dose into account,
         as in equation (3), when accumulating the dose for normal tissue and tumours with
         low α/β, such as the prostate, and for hypofractionated treatments.
      
      Table 1. Summary of the treatment planning objectives and the radiobiological parameters used
            in the evaluation
      The “plan of the day” treatment scenario described above requires a tailored dose
         distribution for each target position for all patient instances, i.e. 
            
               
                  d
                  M
                  
                     i
                  
               
             in equation (1). To save computation time and make the result less dependent of the
         intrinsic details of the optimiser we displace the dose distribution according to
         the fraction specific CTV displacement. This results in one optimisation per margin
         size and spot size regimen.
      
      The scanned proton dose distribution was calculated using an in-house pencil beam
         algorithm with the depth dose and lateral scattering calculated according to Bortfeld
         [29] and Russell et al.[30], respectively. Our normal beam model (NBM) parameters are based on data from Kimstrand
         et al.[31]. Dose mapping in the presence of a sharp penumbra will be sensitive to the registration
         uncertainty, especially for targets where the loss of dose coverage can greatly affect
         the outcome. Dose distributions were therefore also generated according to a sharp
         penumbra beam model (SBM) whose in-air spot sizes are smaller and with zero divergence
         thus producing a sharper penumbra. The spot sizes of SBM correspond approximately
         to what modern commercial proton machines can deliver, e.g. see [32]. The penumbra width is often reported as the distance that the dose falls from 80%
         to 20% of the target dose and here they were 1.16 and 0.88 cm for NBM and SBM respectively
         in the directions perpendicular to the beam axis. The spot size increase with treatment
         depth, due to multiple scatter of the protons, and note that a shallower target will
         have a sharper penumbra and thus more sensitive to dose mapping uncertainties.
