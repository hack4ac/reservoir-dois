				In the aim of searching for new antifungal products from marine origin, we have isolated a sphingosine derivative, ( 9Z )-2-amino-docos-9-ene-1,3,13,14-tetraol (Haliscosamine) from the Moroccan sea sponge  Haliclona viscosa  using bio-guided (antifungal) HPLC methods. The molecular structure of this compound was elucidated by spectrometric techniques IR, UV, MS and NMR. The isolated metabolite showed a significant antifungal activity against  Cryptococcus  and  Candida  species and a weak general toxicity in the brine shrimp lethality test. Further research is needed to study its  in vivo  activity, as well as to elucidate the mechanism underlying its activity in the hope of a future use in medical mycology.
