Methods
   
      Figure&nbsp;1 presented a schematic view of our approach. A comprehensive PPI network was obtained
         by integrating data from different interactions databases [36] (Box A). A set of known breast cancer genes (KnownSet) was extracted from the OMIM
         and CGC databases (Box B). Candidate genes were first ranked by three network topological
         attributes: node degree, node betweenness and by their closeness to known cancer genes
         in the network (Box C). GO term enrichment analyses were performed for KnownSet, producing
         a GO term set enriched with breast cancer related terms, into which a group of cancer-hallmark
         GO terms were also added [37]. A set of genes which were annotated with terms in the obtained GO set were generated,
         which was called the GO enriched gene set (GOSet) (Box D). A batch of breast cancer-related
         expression data was extracted from the GEO database [38] on April 7, 2011 and expression profiles in those data files were clustered based
         on their similarity with each other (Box E). Expression clusters were intersected
         with GOSet. Overlap significance was represented by a p-value computed with the normal
         distribution. The p-value was utilized to rank genes in expression clusters (Box F).
         All individual rankings from different data sources were finally combined into a final
         ranking, which represented a gene’s overall probability of being involved in breast
         cancer (Box G).
      
      Deriving known breast cancer gene set
      Thirty known breast cancer genes were extracted from the OMIM database [39] and 19 from the CGC database [40] (Table&nbsp;3). For a gene to be usable, it was required to be covered by both the PPI network
         and expression data sets. With that requirement, 26 genes derived from OMIM (OMIMSet)
         and 11 additional genes from CGC (CGCSet) were obtained, this set of 37 genes was
         called the KnownSet.
      
      Table 3. The known breast cancer genes
      Ranking by PPI network
      The human PPI data were derived from five sources: HPRD [41], BioGRID [42], homoMINT [43], IntAct [44] and a manually curated human signalling network [45]. Protein identifiers were mapped to uniform coding gene identifiers. Official gene
         symbols were used as identifier. Redundant interactions were removed, along with interactions
         with identifiers that could not be mapped to gene symbols (Table&nbsp;1). The final PPI network was represented by an undirected graph where nodes representing
         genes and edges representing interactions. The graph contained 156,459 interactions
         connecting 15,494 genes.
      
      Similarities between proteins were found to be correlated with their proximity in
         the PPI network [46]. It was assumed that when a gene in the PPI network exhibited topological features
         similar to known breast cancer genes, it’s more likely to be involved in breast cancer
         processes. Several papers had shown that cancer genes could be effectively distinguished
         from others by their topological attributes in the PPI network, such as node degree
         [47], betweenness centrality [48] and shortest path length [10]. The above three network topological indices were computed and used to assess gene
         similarity in the PPI network. Genes were then sorted according to values of the topological
         indices.
      
      Let G(V,E) be the PPI network, where V is the set of genes, and E the set of interactions in the network.
      
      For a node v∈V, degreecd(v) is the number of direct neighbours of v in the network. Betweenness centrality is the sum of the fraction of all-pair shortest paths that pass through v[49]. It can be expressed as following,

            jk(v) is the number of those paths passing through some node v other than j,k. If j=k,

      The shortest path length was defined as the average shortest path distance from all known breast cancer genes
         to node v, it can be denoted as following,

      where G is the KnownSet, d(v,t) is the shortest path length between node v and t. n is the number of known breast cancer genes which can be reached by v.
      
      The above topological attributes were computed with the Python package networkx [50]. To facilitate later integration step, they were transformed into rankings; that
         is, each list was sorted, and a gene was assigned a positive integer number for a
         specific attribute according to that attribute’s value in the sorted list (Figure&nbsp;6). In the end, three rankings for each gene were obtained based on its topological
         attributes in the network. SN(v) was the topology-based ranking score of a gene v, which was calculated from the three network topological attributes: node degree, shortest path length and node betweenness, SN(v) = (cd(v) + cspl(v) + cb(v))/3.
      
      Figure 6. Ranking genes by network attributes. Genes of the PPI network were sorted according to network attributes (node degree
         was used as an example here). The scores were then converted into ranking values.
      
      Deriving GO enriched gene set
      GO provides a controlled vocabulary of terms for describing genes and gene products
         [17]. GO enrichment analysis assesses whether certain GO annotations are significantly
         over represented among a set of genes [51]. The level of enrichment can be represented by a p-value based on specific probability
         distribution. The p-value is calculated by randomly picking sets of genes from the
         genome and computing the probability of obtaining more genes with GO terms annotated
         to those in the study set [52]. The smaller the p-value, the more significant the GO term is enriched in the gene
         set. For the KnownSet, we used three tools (DAVID [53], GOstats [54], GOEAST [55]) to perform enrichment analyses in the BP (Biological Process) sub-ontology. DAVID
         and GOEAST are online tools and GOstats is an R package from Bioconductor [56]. The top 50 enriched terms were picked from results obtained by each of those tools.
         The three enriched GO term sets from the three tools were combined into one GO term
         set by taking their union. In addition, cancer-hallmark related GO terms are those
         characteristically related to cancers, they should also be included. The set of cancer-hallmark
         GO terms listed in Table&nbsp;1 of [37] were added to the above obtained GO term set, which was then remapped to a set of
         corresponding genes based on human GO annotations. Genes not covered by our PPI network
         were removed. The obtained set of genes was enriched with BP terms annotated to known
         breast cancer genes; they thus were more likely to be involved in breast cancer than
         randomly selected genes. This set of genes was called the GO enriched gene set (GOSet)
         (Figure&nbsp;7).
      
      Figure 7. Getting GO enriched gene set by GO enrichment analysis. Three different tools were used to perform GO term enrichment analyse for known breast
         cancer genes. Top 50 enriched GO terms were picked from results obtained by each tool,
         and their union were generated. Nine cancer-hallmark GO terms from [37] were added into the enriched GO term set. The enriched GO term set were re-mapped
         back to a set of human genes based on Homo sapiens GO annotations, called the GO enriched
         gene set (GOSet).
      
      Ranking by gene expression and GO
      All breast cancer-related gene expression datasets (keywords: Homo sapiens &amp; breast cancer) were download from the GEO database [38]. Data sets with fewer than five samples or conditions were deleted. Data sets of
         normal versus cancer samples were used so those containing recurred versus non-recurred
         samples were deleted. 53 GDSes (GEO data sets) were thus obtained.
      
      For each GDS, records with “null” information and genes which didn’t exist in the PPI network were removed, and if
         a gene had more than one expression profiles, its expression was defined as the profile
         which had the largest mean value [57], defined as:

               (3)
      
      where n is the set of expression profiles for gene i in a GDS, m is the number of samples/conditions in one of those profiles, and ek(j) is the corresponding expression value of sample j.
      
      After the above mentioned preprocessing steps, genes in each GDS were clustered by
         the APCluster algorithm according to their expression profiles. APCluster is an algorithm
         based on affinity propagation which works by considering all data points as potential
         cluster centers at the same time and setting up messages of similarity between any
         two data points, messages are exchanged among data points until all clusters are determined.
         APCluster had been shown to perform well compared to other clustering approaches [58,59]. Pearson correlation coefficient between gene expression profiles was used as the
         similarity metric for APCluster. It was assumed that genes within a cluster would
         have higher probability of being involved in certain biological processes than those
         across clusters.
      
      Overlaps of expression clusters with the GOSet were next computed. To evaluate significance
         of the overlaps, the same number of genes was randomly sampled as those in the cluster
         from GDS, and its overlap with the GOSet was computed; the procedure was repeated
         1000 times for each cluster. A p-value was then computed for the clusters (Figure&nbsp;8). Rankings were assigned to clusters according to their p-values; that is, the lower
         the p-value, the higher the position in the ranking list. Genes in the same clusters
         were assigned the same ranking. A ranking score SE(i) was thus obtained for genes in each GDS, where i represented a specific GDS. A score SE was assigned for each gene by computing the average of SE(i) from all relevant GDSes.
      
      Figure 8. Ranking gene clusters from GEO expression profiles. For a cluster i, random samples of same size were drawn from the same GDS and their overlaps with
         GOSet were computed. P-value was used to represent significance of a cluster’s overlap
         with GOSet. The smaller the p-value, the higher the ranking.
      
      Ranking integration
      For a gene v, the ranking scores based on network topology and expression clustering were combined
         into an overall ranking as following,
      
      
         
               
                  
                     S

               (4)
      
      SE(v) was the expression-based ranking score of gene v, which was computed from breast cancer-related gene expression data and GO annotations.
         λ (0≤λ≤1) is a coefficient to weigh the contribution of topological attributes and expression
         information in ranking breast cancer genes. The average ranking of genes in the KnownSet
         that sorted into top 10% was computed as the P-score. A smaller P-score meant better
         performance, that is, it was more likely to find true breast cancer genes from the
         top of the sorted list. S(v) is the final ranking for a gene v, which reflected the belief that a specific gene was a potential breast cancer gene.
         The higher a gene was ranked, the more likely it was involved in breast cancer related
         processes.
      
      Random walk approach
      The steps in [13] were followed to perform random walk. It iteratively transitions a walker from its
         current node to a randomly selected neighbour. Assuming W is the adjacency matrix of the PPI network and pt is a vector whose i-th element holds the probability of arriving at node i at step t. Random walk was computed by

                        p
                        t
                     
                     +

      where p0 is the initial probability, which is 1/37 for the 37 genes in the KnownSet and 0
         for all others; r represents the probability of remaining at the same node at the next step. [30] showed that random walk worked robustly against different r values, which was also confirmed by our computation (data not shown). r was taken to be 0.7 in the current work. For details of random walk approach, see
         [13].
      
      Ranking performance comparison
      OMIMSet contained 26 known breast cancer genes, CGCSet contained additional 11. The
         26 known breast cancer genes in the OMIMSet were used as the KnownSet. Procedure in
         Figure&nbsp;1 was followed and the model built, which was then used to rank the 11 known breast
         cancer genes in the CGCSet. Ranking values in italic meant those genes were ranked in the top 10% of the final list. The row of “top 10%
         average” represented average rankings of those known breast cancer genes in CGCSet
         that ranked in top 10%, while “all 11 test genes average” represented the average
         rankings of all 11 genes in the CGCSet (Table&nbsp;2). In later computation, OMIMSet and CGCSet were combined into a KnownSet of 37 genes.
      
      Performance evaluation against realistic data noise
      GOSet was a set of genes enriched with probable breast cancer genes. Its quality was
         obviously lower than the KnownSet, but higher than a set of random genes nonetheless.
         To evaluate the proposed method’s robustness with respect to noise in real life data
         sources, multiples of 37 (the number of known breast cancer genes in the PPI network)
         genes were sampled from the GOSet (ranging from 0 to 50, with 0 meaning no noise added).
         Each sample was combined with the KnownSet into an ntegrated source data. Stratified
         cross-validation was utilized for performance comparison between the proposed approach
         and the random walk method [13]. The sampled genes were randomly partitioned into five equal subsets, one of the
         five subsets was retained for testing, and the remaining four subsets were used as
         training data. The KnownSet was also randomly divided into five equal parts. One of
         them was combined with one subset of the sampled genes as testing data, the other
         four with the four remaining subsets of the sample as training data. This procedure
         was then repeated five times, with each of the five subsets used once as testing data.
         All results from the five folds were averaged to generate the final result. Performance
         of the proposed approach and random walk method with respect to data noise were evaluated
         in terms of the F-score, which was computed from precision and recall (Figure&nbsp;9). Precision was the fraction of genes ranked within top k in the test data that were true known cancer genes; recall was the fraction of known
         breast cancer genes ranking within top k. F-score was then the harmonic mean of precision and recall. k was the ranking threshold that was used to decide whether a ranked gene was considered
         as a predicted positive, that is, genes ranked higher than k were judged as breast
         cancer genes. The F-score was defined as following,

         which had been predicted as breast cancer genes by the proposed method. Precision
         represented ability to reject unrelated genes, and recall represented ability to obtain

      One F-score was computed for each fold, averaging five F-scores (for five-fold cross
         validation) produced the final F-score.
      
      Performance evaluation against completely random noise
      Random genes were first sampled from the PPI network and added to the KnownSet. Procedure
         in Figure&nbsp;1 and random walk computation were then performed. Figure&nbsp;5 plotted the ratio of random genes to the number of genes in KnownSet (37) and the
         proportion of added random genes that ranked within top 10%.
