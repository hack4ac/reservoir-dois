						Introduction

					Extraosseous uptake of  99m Tc-hydroxymethylene diphosphonate is a common situation of variable clinical relevance.

				
				
					
						Case presentation

					A 52-year-old Caucasian woman presented to our department for breast cancer staging. A  99m Tc-hydroxymethylene diphosphonate bone scan was performed and showed focal pelvic hyperfixation that disclosed intrauterine device migration into the anterior wall of the bladder on single photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography.

				
				
					
						Conclusion

					This observation confirms the major role of single photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography in achieving an exact diagnosis.
