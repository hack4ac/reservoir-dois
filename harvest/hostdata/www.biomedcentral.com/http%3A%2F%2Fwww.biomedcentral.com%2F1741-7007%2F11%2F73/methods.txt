Methods
   
      p53-Venus reporter cell line
      The U-2 OS and A549 cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection
         (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 in McCoy’s 5A or F-12K medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/ml
         penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. To generate fluorescent reporter cell for live-cell
         imaging of p53 dynamics, we infected U-2 OS and A549 cells with lentiviruses encoding
         an established p53-Venus reporter construct (consisting of wild-type p53 fused to
         a yellow fluorescent protein, Venus; generous gift from Dr Galit Lahav, Department
         of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, USA) [9], and selected isogenic clones.
      
      Chemicals and reagents
      Etoposide was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). siRNA for knocking
         down Mdm2 (#4457298) was purchased from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX, USA), and the Mdm2
         siRNA was used at a final concentration of 20 nmol/l for RNAi in all experiments.
         The non-targeting siRNA control was On-Target plus siControl (#D-001810-01; Dharmacon
         Inc., Lafayette, CO, USA). All siRNA transfections were performed using HiPerFect
         (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
         Experiments were conducted after 48 hours of gene silencing.
      
      Western blotting analysis
      Cell lysates were obtained using LDS sample buffer (NuPAGE; Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad,
         CA, USA). Proteins were resolved on Tris-glycine gels and transferred onto PVDF membranes.
         Blots were probed with commercial primary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence
         detection using (ECL-Plus; Amersham Biosciences Inc., Piscataway, NJ, USA). Antibodies
         used were: PARP1 (#9542), p21 (#2947), Puma (#4976), TFIIB (#4169), phospho-p53 (Ser20)
         (#9287), phospho-p53 (Ser46) (#2521) and acetyl-p53 (Lys382) (all Cell Signaling Technology/(Danvers,
         MA, USA); acetyl-p53 (Lys120; #BAM-71-131-EX; Cosmo Bio, Yokohama, Japan); p53 (#sc-126),
         Mdm2 (#sc-965) and Bax (#sc-493) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA,
         USA); phospho-histone H2A.X (#06-570; Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA, USA). Anti-actin
         (#A5316; (Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-tubulin (#2148; Cell Signaling Technology) were
         used as loading controls.
      
      Real-time quantitative PCR
      Total cellular RNA was isolated from U-2 OS cells (RNeasy Mini Kit; Qiagen) in accordance
         with the manufacturer’s instructions. A high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit
         (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) was used to reverse-transcribe RNA into
         cDNA, and a SYBR Green system (Fast SYBR Green Master Mix; Applied Biosystems) was
         used for DNA amplification on a PCR system (7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System; Applied
         Biosystems). The data were analyzed by Sequence Detection Systems Software (version
         2.3). For the primer sequences for the respective genes, see Additional file 1: Table S1.
      
      Subcellular fractionation
      U-2 OS cells were treated with trypsin, rinsed twice with PBS, and then lysed at 4°C
         with isotonic buffer (10 mmol/l Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mmol/l MgCl2, 3 mmol/l CaCl2, 3 mol/l sucrose) supplemented with 1 mmol/ldithiothreitol (DTT) and protease inhibitor
         cocktail (set III; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA). Lysis buffer was used at 100 μl
         per 20 μl of packed cell volume (PCV). Detergent (IGEPAL CA-630; Rhodia, La Défense,
         France) was then added to a final concentration of 0.03 to 0.05%, and sample was immediately
         separated by centrifugation for 30 seconds at 11,000 g and 4°C. The resulting supernatant
         was taken as the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was then rinsed twice with 100 μl
         isotonic buffer, and taken as the nuclear fraction for western blot analysis.
      
      Time-lapse microscopy and image analysis
      Cells were plated in 35 mm imaging dishes (μ-dish; ibidi, Planegg, Germany) and cultured
         in phenol red-free CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and
         100 μl streptomycin. Cell images were acquired with an inverted microscope (TE2000-PFS;
         Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) enclosed in a humidified chamber maintained at 37°C. Cells were
         imaged every 10 minutes using a motorized stage and a ×20 objective.
      
      For data plotted in the cumulative survival curves and the phenotype distributions,
         we viewed and analyzed the images manually by eye, using MetaMorph software (Molecular
         Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). In the phase-contrast images, we scored by morphological
         tracking the following: interphase (by flat morphology), entry into mitosis (by cell
         rounding), cell division (by re-spreading and splitting), cell-cycle arrest (by absence
         of cell division for 72 hours) and cell death (by blebbing followed by cell lysis).
         For quantifying the single-cell p53 traces, we used an automatic cell-tracking program
         that we developed using MatLab. The program consists of image-analysis procedures
         that sequentially segment the individual cells, track them in time, identify the nucleus,
         and measure the p53 fluorescence intensity in the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively.
         Based on the quantified p53 fluorescent trajectories, we classified the dynamic mode
         of nuclear p53 manually by eye. We categorized as ‘oscillatory’ any single-cell p53
         signals in the nucleus that exhibited periodic fluctuations in intensity between a
         high fluorescent state and a low state near background fluorescence. We defined a
         nuclear p53 signal that monotonically rose to and sustained at a high fluorescence
         level as ‘monotonic increase’. Most (approximately 95%) of the p53 trajectories had
         obvious features that could be unambiguously categorized into the two distinct modes.
         For the 5% of trajectories that had ambiguous features (mostly occurring at the intermediate
         DNA damage level), we discarded these trajectories from further analysis.
