      Bioinformatics
      Bioinformatic analyses relied heavily on custom python scripts and the use of publically
         available tools such as SAMtools [76] and BEDtools [77], as well as general data handling in R [78]. Python scripts critical for the analyses are available as supplementary material
         (Additional file 14). Data were visualized in the Integrative Genomics viewer [79].

      RNA-seq mapping and transcriptome assembly
      Embryo collection and RNA sequencing was performed as previously described [5]. Raw data files are available from NCBI’s short read archive (GSE22830). Reads were
         mapped using Bioscope 1.3 (with default settings) and TopHat 1.3.1 (with default options
         except: -a = 5, -I = 50, -F = 0). The resulting SAM-files were merged and a python
         script (best_alignment.py) used to ensure that a read were only present once. We performed
         transcriptome assembly using Cufflinks (version 1.2.1), with Ensembl annotation as
         guide (Zv9, annotation version 64), using default settings except; F = 0.0, -j = 0.05,
         -A = 0.08, --3-overhang-tolerance = 100. Additional programs in the Cufflinks pipeline
         were used to merge files, compare transcripts to known annotation and detect differences
         between the stages [80]. We created additional datasets using scripts; FPKM &gt; 3 using extract_gtf.py, TSS’s
         using get_tss_bed.py and TTS using get_tts.py.
      
      Sequence analysis
      We extracted transcript sequences using gffread in Cufflinks. These were subjected
         to ORF prediction using getORF (with settings: -minsize 150, -sreverse_sequence No,
         -find 1) from the EMBOSS suite [81]. The resulting protein sequences were processed by scripts and R handling to retrieve
         the longest predicted ORF. We used Pfam to identify functional domains (Pfam A) [31] and domains considered significant by Pfam were used. A script (‘domain_compare.py’)
         was used to identify if domains were retained, lost or gained relative to the closest
         matching transcript. Detection of motifs in the 3’UTR was performed using UTRScan
         [82].
      
      Alternative splicing
      We used ASTALAVISTA version 2.2 [51] to quantify alternative splicing events. This program takes as input a GTF file (FPKM &gt; 3)
         and outputs all splicing events in the annotation together with a code representing
         type of event (exon skipping, intron retention, alternative acceptor site, alternative
         donor site). We used python scripts to extract and count events from the ASTALAVISTA
         output (summary.py and events.py).
      
      Detection of length changes in last exon
      We designed a database of non-redundant last exons (get_last_exon.py) and after initial
         filtering (exons &gt; 400&nbsp;bp, FPKM &gt; 3 in both samples, n = 10,349 last exons) we used
         a script (find_extended_utrs.py) to idenitfy exons with a length change between pre-
         and post-ZGA. This was achieved by counting the number of reads in the first and latter
         part of the exon. A score was calculated as follows:
      
      
         
               
                  
                     Q
                     =
                     
                        
                           p
                           2
                           –
                           p
                           1
                        
                     
                     *
                     log
                     
                        
                           
                              FPKM
                              pre
                           
                           +
                           
                              FPKM
                              
                                 post
                                 )
                              
                           
                           /
                           2
                        
                     
                  
               
         
      
      where p1 and p2 are the proportions of reads in the last part of the exon relative
         to the first part pre- and post-ZGA, respectively. Exons with a shift towards more
         reads in the last part post-ZGA will have a positive value. We weighted this value
         using the log-transformed average of the exons FPKM values pre- and post-ZGA, assuming
         that higher coverage gives a more robust estimate of change.
      
      Analysis of ChIP-seq data
      Embryos for ChIP-seq were collected at 5.3 hpf and chromatin prepared as described
         [83]. In accordance with institutional, national and international guidelines for early
         stage (0–5.3 hpf) zebrafish embryos no ethics committee approval was needed for any
         of the experiments performed in this study. Immunoprecipitation was performed using
         H3K36me3 (Diagenode 058–050, Denville, NJ) and ChIP enriched DNA and input samples
         prepared for sequencing according to Illumina standard protocol (#11257047 Rev.A).
         ChIP-seq reads were mapped using BWA [84] and peaks detected using CCAT 3.0 (Settings: fragment size = 200, sliding window
         size = 500, minimum score = 3.0) [85]. Intron and exons from single exon skipping events identified by ASTALAVISTA were
         extracted with a script (extract_skipped_exon.py) and BEDtools used to count the number
         of reads supporting each event. Events with &gt;5 reads post-ZGA were considered further.
         We created databases of all introns and exons using the ‘all’ annotation. The number
         of overlapping peaks and skipped exons (&gt;1&nbsp;bp overlap between peak and exon skipping
         event: from start upstream intron to stop downstream intron) were calculated using
         BEDtools and the random control using a script (bootstr_rand.py). We utilized Repitools
         to construct metagens [86]. H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 peak data were from a recently published paper (Pauli et al.,
         2012). We identified potential bidirectional promoters using ChIPpeakAnno [87] with the H3K4me3 data [13] and the ‘all’ gene annotation file. The TSS of either gene in the pair had to be
         within 1000&nbsp;bp of the middle of the H3K4me3 peak.
      
      PCR and cloning
      Newly assembled and annotated isoforms were validated by RT-(q)PCR. RNA from pools
         of embryos at different stages was isolated using TRIzol reagent followed by RNA cleanup
         using Qiagen RNeasy MiniKit (Hilden, Germany) as previously described [88]. Control RNA of kanamycin (Promega #C1381, Madison, Wisconsin) was added prior to
         the RNA extraction and used as the reference control by qPCR. RNA was reverse transcribed
         using iScript Select cDNA synthesis Kit (BioRad #170-8896, Hercules, CA) according
         to the manufactures instructions. Primers were designed to cover specific sequences
         resulting from alternative splicing (f11r), alternative TSS (dazl), and alternative last exon usage (magi1) (for details see Supplementary Table 1 in Additional file 15). The dynamics of the isoforms was confirmed by RT-qPCR. qPCR was performed with
         the iCycler MyiQ real time PCR detection system and SYBR Green (BioRad, Hercules,
         CA). Primers pairs gave no signal in PCRs lacking template (data not shown). Relative
         expression was determined by the ∆∆-CT method. For pou5f1, both primers were designed in the sequence common for the predicted isoforms (Supplementary
         Table 1 in Additional file 15). Presence of the isoforms at 3.5 hpf was confirmed by TOPO TA cloning (Invitrogen
         K45-0001, Carlsberg, CA) and subsequent sequencing of randomly selected clones.
