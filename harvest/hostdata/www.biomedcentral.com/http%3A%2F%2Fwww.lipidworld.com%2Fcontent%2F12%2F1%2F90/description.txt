						Background

					
						 Carissa opaca  leaves are traditionally used in the treatment of male dysfunction and hormonal disorder as well as in oxidative stress in Pakistan and Asia. The present study was designed to assess the protective effects of methanolic extract of  Carissa opaca  leaves (MLC) on carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 )-induced reproductive stress in male rats and bioactive constituents responsible for the activity.

				
				
					
						Methods

					CCl 4  was induced in 42 male rats for eight weeks and checked the protective efficacy of methanolic extract of  Carissa opaca  leaves at various hormonal imbalances, alteration of antioxidant enzymes, DNA fragmentation levels and lipid peroxidation caused testicular fibrosis in testis while High performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used for detection of bioactive components.

				
				
					
						Results

					HPLC characterization revealed the presence of isoquercitin , hyperoside , vitexin , myricetin and kaempherol. CCl 4  caused significant alteration in the secretion of reproductive hormones. Activity of antioxidant enzymes viz; catalase, superoxide dimutase and phase II metabolizing enzymes including glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and reduced glutathione was decreased while DNA fragmentation, hydrogen per oxide contents and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were increased with CCl 4  treatment. Co-administration of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg b.w. MLC effectively ameliorated the alterations in the biochemical markers; hormonal and molecular levels.

				
				
					
						Conclusion

					Protective effects of methanolic extract of  Carissa opaca  against CCl 4âˆ’ induced antioxidant and hormonal dysfunction which might be due to bioactive compound present in extract.
