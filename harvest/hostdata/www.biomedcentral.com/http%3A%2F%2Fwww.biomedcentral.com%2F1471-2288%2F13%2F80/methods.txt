Methods
   
      The illness-death or disability model is a very useful tool for describing the course
         of breast cancer. Figure&nbsp;1 shows this model in the case of “overall survival”. For the analysis of “distant
         disease free” survival, the state “death” is replaced by “distant metastases or death”.
         The variable t denotes the time since first diagnosis, d denotes the time of ILRR.

      When using common regression models for censored data, there are three possible approaches
         for the estimation of the transition hazards: separate models for every transition
         (approach S), time-dependent covariates (approach J) [12], and the stratified model [13]. There are also mixture models, e.g. one proposed in [2]. In the following paragraphs, we explain how these methods estimate the transition
         hazards and which assumptions are (indirectly) made.
      
      The Cox regression model [14] is used throughout the article. The definitions are as follows: λ0(t) denotes the baseline hazard, λ12(t), λ13(t) and λ23(t,d) are the hazard functions for the three possible transitions. The parameter vector
         for the time-dependent covariates is β, for the time-invariant covariates γ is used. The time-invariant covariates are denoted by z. Time-dependent covariates can either depend on t, the time since the first diagnosis, or d, the time of the intermediate event. We define two time-varying covariates as follows:

      which we denote only by d and t - d in the following. We are now interested in the functional form with which these variables
         enter the hazard function. We therefore transform (t - d) and d by a function f: f(d,t - d). At this stage, the shape of the function f is not yet determined. In paragraph Shape of the time-varying covariate some possible
         choices are proposed for doing this.
      
      Problems can arise when sojourn times and in general random time-dependent covariates
         are included into multi-state models. For example, cumulative incidence functions
         cannot longer be estimated in a straightforward way. Such situations were studied
         by [15] and [11]. The latter paper points out that “studying [...] sojourn times as time-dependent
         covariates may be useful for testing model assumptions and for investigating their
         effect on the survival” and treats this kind of problem in section 4.1 [11]. The model mentioned by these authors is equivalent to our straight line model of
         Section Shape of the time-varying covariate.
      
      The following two paragraphs discuss the joint transition hazards approach J and the separate transition hazards approach S.
      
      Joint approach
      Approach J models transitions 1 →3 and 2 →3 jointly. A time-varying covariate indicates whether
         the patient is in state 1 or 2 and therefore if the first or the second hazard function
         is “active”. The model is:

      If this approach is used, the time-invariant covariates z are assumed to have the same effect on both transitions to the absorbing state (common
         parameter γ). For transition 1 →2 the effects of the covariates are modelled separately (γ12 independent of γ). The relation between the hazards λ13 and λ23 is defined as c(d,t - d):= exp (βTf(d,t - d)). If only the time-varying indicator is used, i.e.f(d,t - d)≡1, the relation c = exp (β) is constant and the transition hazards 1 →3 and 2 →3 are assumed to be proportional.
         If c = 1, the hazard function is not changed by the intermediate event. If assumption
         of proportionality is not realistic, time-dependent structures can be added to the
         function c as shown in Table&nbsp;1.
      
      Table 1. Possible relations between transitions 1 → 3 and 2 → 3 if approach J is used
      Models J.III (1 and 2) and model J.IV violate the Markov assumption. The estimated
         parameters of the time-varying covariates allow for testing directly the difference
         between the hazards before and after the intermediate event. The models are nested
         and it is therefore possible to use directly a criterion (AIC for example) to assess
         the goodness of fit. This constitutes an advantage of this approach.
      
      Separate approach
      Approach S models all transition hazards separately. The transition λ12 is modelled like in approach J (eq.(1)). Therefore we obtain :

      The time-invariant covariates are allowed to have different effects on all hazards.
         The time-dependency of the hazard 2 →3 on the time of recurrence d and the time since recurrence t - d is modelled via the function f. Approach J is a special case of model S.
      
      Using this approach, one has to chose the time-scale for the function λ0,23 what is not self-evident. In equation (2) the time since the first diagnosis t is chosen. This approach is often called “clock forward” approach. Figure&nbsp;2 shows that there is a second possibility: the time since recurrence t - d can also be used (called the “clock reset” approach). If the time-scale t is chosen, only individuals who have already changed to state 2 can be used for the
         estimation of λ0,23. It is therefore necessary to account for left-truncation. The implementation of
         the time-scale t - d is easier. However, when using time since recurrence, the comparison of the hazard
         rates before and after recurrence is no longer straightforward.
      
      Figure 2. After the recurrence, two time scales are possible: time since first diagnosist or time since recurrencet-d.
      Approach S is a special case of the stratified model [13]. The stratified model assumes different baseline hazards for all transitions. The
         covariates can be chosen to have identical effects for all transitions or can be stratified
         by transition whereas the baseline hazards remain different for all three transitions.
         As the main interest of this article is the modelling of the time-dependent covariates
         and not the effect of the “standard” covariates, we use approach S as described above.
      
      Shape of the time-varying covariate
      Fractional polynomials (FP) are used for the modelling of the function f. Fractional polynomials were introduced in [16] and are explained in detail in [17]. In order to carry out model selection using FPs, a sequential selection procedure
         was proposed in [18]. Our approach is similar to the approach of [19], where time - covariate interaction was investigated using FPs; for a comprehensive
         overview see [20].
      
      By contrast, in the situation investigated here, fractional polynomials are directly
         applied on the time-varying covariates d and t - d. The resulting FP gives the function f which describes the shape of the impact of the time-dependent covariates on the hazard
         function λ23. Using approach J, it also determines the relation between function λ13 and λ23 as c(d,t - d)= exp (βTf(d,t - d)).
      
      The procedure is the following: Suppose that X is a time-dependent covariate. We are interested in finding the function f(.) that describes the impact of the time-dependent covariate on the hazard function.
         The starting point is a straight line model f(X) = β1X. In some cases, this is already an adequate description of the relationship, but
         other models are analysed in order to improve the fit. The extension of the straight
         line model are power functions β1Xp. The values of p are chosen from the set S = {-2,-1,-0.5,0,0.5,1,2,3} where X0 denotes log(X). The resulting functions are called one-term fractional polynomials or FP1 functions.
         The variable that counts the number of FP-terms m is set to 1. In this article also FP2 functions are used:

      In order to find the best model, the 8 different FP1 functions and the 36 different
         FP2 functions are fitted and compared using the AIC criterion [21].
      
      If there are several time-dependent covariates, linear combinations of the FP of every
         covariate are used. A model selection procedure treating several covariates is described
         in [18].
