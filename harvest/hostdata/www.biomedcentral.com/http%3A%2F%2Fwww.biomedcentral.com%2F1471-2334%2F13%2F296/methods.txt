      Study population and hospital
      Nha Trang is the capital city of the Khanh Hoa Province in South-Central Vietnam.
         Temperatures are high throughout the year (average 26°C), and the rainy season is
         from September through December. According to the Vietnam Population and Housing Census
         and our previously conducted population-based survey, the total mid-year pop-ulation
         in the city in 2009 was 392,279, with76% of ≥15 years and 6.4% of ≥ 65 years old [16,17]. Influenza vaccine and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine had not been included
         in the national immunisation programme at the time of the study. The introduction
         of the H. influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine for all infants aged 2, 3, and 4 months did not take
         place until May 2010.
      
      The Khanh Hoa General Hospital (KHGH) is a pro-vincial-level referral hospital that
         provides primary and tertiary care for residents. According to our previous survey,
         the hospital served as the sole provider of hospital care for severe diseases in Nha
         Trang City [16].
      
      Patient enrolment
      All physicians and infectious disease specialists screened adult patients hospitalised
         with acute LRTI. Our target population was all patients aged ≥15 years residing in
         Khanh Hoa Province who were hospitalised with any signs of LRTI from September 1,
         2009, through August 31, 2010. A patient was classified as having LRTI if presenting
         to the hospital with at least two of the following symptoms: (1) fever and/or cough
         (2) fast and/or difficulty of breathing, or (3) any additional severe symptoms including
         respiratory rate over 30 per minute, SpO2 under 90%, systolic blood pressure under
         90 mmHg, pulse rate more than 130/min, white blood cell count over 20,000 or under
         4,000 cells/μL, CRP over 20 mg/dl, dehydrated, altered consciousness and other worse
         general status. Patients were excluded from the study if they had been hospitalised
         within the previous week, or have been diagnosed other than LRTI, or if no interpretable
         chest X-ray was obtained. These criteria were based on criteria in previous studies
         of CAP and modified considering local settings [18].
      
      Demographic and clinical information were collected using a standardised form. The
         forms were filled out by the hospital physicians, and the data were verified by one
         dedicated research clinician and one research assistant. Malnutrition was defined
         as clinically apparent weight loss or skinny and pale appearance accompanied with
         disability or reduction of eating for more than 7 days. Status of human immunodeficiency
         virus (HIV) infection was not routinely tested but positive results in previous test
         were noted. Blood, sputum, and flocked nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens were obtained
         from the participants immediately after admission and completion of an informed consent
         form. Chest X-rays were taken within 48 hours of admission.
      
      Laboratory testing
      The clinical specimens were immediately transported to the hospital laboratory. Gram
         staining was performed on all sputum, and the specimen quality was evaluated according
         to Geckler’s category [19]. Conventional bacterial culture was performed by trained laboratory technicians.
         To each of the NPS specimens, 800 μl of normal saline (NS) was added for processing;
         then, 140 μl of this fluid was transferred to a medium containing skim milk, tryptone,
         glucose, and glycerine (STGG media). Another 200 μl of the NPS-saline solution was
         added to viral transfer media (VTM). Residual sputum samples and VTM were stored at
         −80°C in the hospital laboratory and transported on ice pack to the Institute of Tropical
         Medicine at Nagasaki University, Japan every three months for further molecular tests.
         The sputum samples were tested by multiplex PCR, which is a conventional PCR with
         mixing three sets of pathogen specific primers to identify three typical pathogenic
         bacteria: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Viral nucleic acid was extracted from VTM using the QIAamp viral RNA extraction
         kit and tested for 13 previously described respiratory viruses: influenza A/B (FLUA,
         FLUB), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Human adenovirus (HAdV), Human rhinovirus
         (HRV), Human bocavirus (HBoV), Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), Human parainfluenza virus
         (HPIV) type 1–4, and Human coronavirus OC43/229E (HCoV) [16].
      
      Definitions of pneumonia
      Patients were classified into either CAP or non-pneumonic lower respiratory tract
         infections (NPLRTI) according to the findings of the chest X-rays. As there are no
         common criteria to interpret adult chest X-ray, the World Health Organization’s guideline
         for childhood pneumonia were modified to standardize the interpretation algorithm
         [20]. A senior pulmonologist and two physicians who were blinded to the clinical course
         interpreted all chest X-ray films independently. A case was categorised as CAP if
         two or more evaluators agreed on the presence of consolidation. The severity of cases
         was assessed using CURB65 and Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) scores [21].
      
      Estimation of the incidence of CAP
      To ensure all CAP cases are counted in the incidence estimation, we obtained the hospital
         admission database with International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10)
         coding along with age, gender, date of admission and discharge and address codes.
         The cases of hospitalised ICD-10 coded pneumonia were defined by ICD-10 codes J10–J18
         (ICD-10 coded pneumonia).
      
      Let La denote the number of actively enrolled cases of LRTI and Ca denote the number of actively enrolled CAP cases with chest X-ray confirmation. Let
         Cd denote the number of cases with ICD-10 coded pneumonia in the hospital database. Amongst
         Cd there were some cases which had been missed by the active enrolment and hence no chest
         X-ray was available to determine whether they attributed to the total incidence of
         CAP. Among those cases which were included in both La and Cd (Lad) we determined the proportion (r), with respect to age group (i) and gender (j), which holds those cases with positive chest X-rays (Cad).

         age groups were also done.
      
      For calculation of the incidence, the population and patients were limited to Nha
         Trang residents because those who reside out of Nha Trang likely to go their own district
         level hospitals for mild symptoms.
      
      Definition of 2009pH1N1 influenza season
      During the study period, 2009pH1N1 influenza outbreak occurred from Sep until Dec
         2009. No cases with 2009pH1N1 influenza infection were detected from Jan 2010 until
         the end of the study according to on-going viral respiratory surveillance in this
         area [16,22]. Incidence of CAP in 2009pH1N1 influenza season was defined as cases detected from
         Sep to Dec 2009.
      
      Data analysis
      The characteristics of patients with CAP and NPLRTI were compared using the chi-squared
         test for categorical variables, a two-tailed unpaired t-test for continuous variables and a nonparametric trend test for ordinal variables.
         Cases were excluded from each comparison if the relevant data were not recorded; imputations
         for missing values were not performed in our analyses. The 95% confidence intervals
         (CIs) for the incidence estimates were calculated using Wilson’s score method. The
         logistic regression analysis was applied to adjust for possible confounding factors.
         All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 12.0 (Stata Corp., USA).
      
      Ethics

         of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Hanoi, Vietnam, and the IRB of the Institute of Tropical
         Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan. Informed consent was obtained in accordance
