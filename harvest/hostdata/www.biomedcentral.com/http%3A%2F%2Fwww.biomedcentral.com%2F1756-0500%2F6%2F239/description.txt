						Background

					
						 Cosmos caudatus  is a local plant which has antioxidant properties and contains high calcium. It is also reported to be able to strengthen the bone. This report is an extension to previously published article in Evidence Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine (doi:10.1155/2012/817814). In this study, we determined the effectiveness of  C. caudatus  as an alternative treatment for osteoporosis due to post-menopause by looking at the dynamic and cellular paramaters of bone histomorphometry.

				
				
					
						Methods

					Forty female Wistar rats were divided into four groups i.e. sham operated, ovariectomized, ovariectomized treated with calcium 1%  ad libitum  and ovariectomized force-fed with 500 mg/kg  C. caudatus  extract. Treatment was given six days a week for eight weeks.

				
				
					
						Results

					Dynamic and cellular histomorphometry parameters were measured.  C. caudatus  increased double-labeled surface (dLS/BS), mineral appositional rate (MAR), osteoid volume (OV/BV) and osteoblast surface (Ob.S/BS).  C. caudatus  also gave better results compared to calcium 1% in the osteoid volume (OV/BV) parameter.

				
				
					
						Conclusions

					
						 C. caudatus  at the 500 mg/kg dose may be an alternative treatment in restoring bone damage that may occur in post-menopausal women.
