Methods
   
      Animals and treatment
      This study utilized thirty-two young adult (3&nbsp;months) female Wistar rats, which were
         obtained from the Laboratory Animal Resource Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti
         Kebangsaan Malaysia. The rats, weighing 190&nbsp;g-260&nbsp;g, were randomly assigned to four
         groups with eight rats in each group. Group 1 was sham operated (Sham) while the second
         group was ovariectomized control group (OVX). The third and fourth groups were ovariectomized
         and treated with calcium 1% (Ca) ad libitum and force-fed with 500&nbsp;mg/kg C. caudatus extract (CC) respectively. The ovariectomy and sham operation protocol was carried
         out as previously described [18]. Rats were left recuperating for 1&nbsp;week before commencing the treatment. Treatment
         was given six days a week for eight weeks. All rats were injected with two doses of
         calcein nine days and two days before sacrificed. The study was approved by the Universiti
         Kebangsaan Malaysia Animal Ethics Committee with the approval code of PP/FAR/2008/NORAZLINA/12-AUGUST/225-SEPT-2008-AUG-2009.
      
      Diet, Cosmos caudatus and calcium 1%
      
      All rats received normal rat chow obtained from Gold Coin, Malaysia. Water extraction
         method was used to obtain 500&nbsp;g/300&nbsp;ml concentration of C. caudatus aqueous extract. Extraction was carried out by School of Chemical Sciences &amp; Food
         Technology, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia as previously
         described [19]. The 500&nbsp;mg/kg dose was prepared by mixing C. caudatus with deionized water in ratio 3:7. Calcium 1% solution was prepared by mixing 1&nbsp;g
         of hemicalcium lactic acid (Sigma Chemical CO., USA) with 100&nbsp;ml deionized water.
      
      Bone histomorphometry
      After 8&nbsp;weeks of treatment, rats were sacrificed via euthanasia with diethyl ether.
         The left femora were removed and the distal parts were fixed in 70% ethanol. Cellular
         parameters measured were osteoid volume (OV/BS, osteoid volume over bone surface),
         osteoid surface (OS/BS, osteoid surface over bone surface), osteoclast surface (Oc.S/BS,
         osteoclast surface over bone surface), osteoblast surface (Ob.S/BS, osteoblast surface
         over bone surface) and eroded surface (ES/BS, eroded surface over bone surface). Bone
         samples were decalcified according to the method described by Hermizi et al. [20]. In addition, undecalcified bone samples were used to measure dynamic parameters
         i.e. single labeled surface (sLS/BS, single labeled surface over bone surface), double-labeled
         surface (dLS/BS, double-labeled surface over bone surface), mineralized surface (MS/BS,
         mineralized surface over bone surface), mineral appositional rate (MAR), and bone
         formation rate (BFR/BS, bone formation rate over bone surface). Preparation of bone
         samples and measurement techniques were carried out as previously described [20].
      
      Statistical analysis
      All data were subjected to normality test using the Kolmogorov test. For normally
         distributed data, the statistical test used was analysis of variance, followed by
         Tukey’s honestly significance difference test. While non-normally distributed data
         were analysed using Mann–Whitney and Kruskal Wallis tests. Data analysis was performed
         using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (18.0.1; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) software.
         Results were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).
