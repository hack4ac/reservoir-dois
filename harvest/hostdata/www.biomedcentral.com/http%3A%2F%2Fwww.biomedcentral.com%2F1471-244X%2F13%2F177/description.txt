						Background

					An interview format version of the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) modified to assess gambling treatment outcomes was assessed for reliability and validity. The SDS assesses impairment in work, family and social functioning related to mental disorders.

				
				
					
						Methods

					A pilot study (N = 21) determined the preferred wording for oral administration. Participants with pathological gambling in a relapse prevention clinical trial completed the scale and other validation measures at baseline, six and twelve month follow-ups (N = 169).

				
				
					
						Results

					Confirmatory factor analysis supported a one factor solution and the scale had good internal reliability for a three item scale. The SDS was sensitive to change and correlations with recent gambling behaviour and severity were moderate as expected. Similarly, correlations with self-efficacy, perceived control over gambling, and craving were moderate, but they were lower for less directly related constructs such as depression and perceived family and friend support.

				
				
					
						Conclusions

					The SDS is a brief, psychometrically sound, outcome measure of impairment associated with gambling disorders that can be administered by telephone.
