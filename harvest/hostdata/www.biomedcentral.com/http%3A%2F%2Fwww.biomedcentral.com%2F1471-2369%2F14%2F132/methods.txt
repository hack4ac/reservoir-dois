Methods
   
      Study design
      NHANES is conducted by the National Center of Health Statistics, Centers for Disease
         Control and Prevention, as a cross-sectional, stratified, multistage probability sample
         survey of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population [24,25]. NHANES data are derived from direct interviews regarding medical history, medication
         use and diet, as well as clinical examinations performed at mobile examination centers
         (including BP measurements) and laboratory tests (including blood and urine biochemistries).
      
      From 1999, NHANES became a continuous survey, with no break between study cycles,
         and data are released in 2-year increments; this analysis used pooled data from the
         5 most recent study cycles: 2001–2002, 2003–2004, 2005–2006, 2007–2008 and 2009–2010.
         Data from the 2001–2002 study cycle were included in this analysis to enable the assessment
         of linear trends in CV risk factor treatment and control before and after the release
         of current lipid and BP treatment guidelines for patients with CKD in 2003 and 2004,
         respectively [11,12]. NHANES 2001–2010 received approval from the National Center for Health Statistics
         research ethics review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all NHANES
         participants [24].
      
      Sample population
      From the total 2001–2010 NHANES population of 52,195 participants, after excluding
         participants &lt;20 years of age (n=24,611), participants that did not attend the mobile
         examination center (n=1,276), participants without fasting laboratory measurements
         (15,162), pregnant women (n=407), participants with missing lipid or BP data (n=788)
         and participants with Stage 5 CKD (n=36), a sample population of 9,915 participants
         was identified for analysis. This analysis was restricted to the fasting subsample
         of NHANES to enable the identification of participants with diabetes and hyperlipidemia,
         the definitions of which require valid fasting plasma glucose and LDL-C levels, respectively
         (described in further detail below). NHANES participants are randomly selected for
         inclusion in the fasting subsample and instructed to fast for 8 to &lt;24 hours prior
         to blood specimens being taken for laboratory testing [25].
      
      Data were stratified by CKD stage, categorized according to the presence of kidney
         damage (based on albuminuria) and level of decline in kidney function (based on estimated
         glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]). Albuminuria was defined as a urinary albumin–creatinine
         ratio of ≥30 mg/g. eGFR was calculated from serum creatinine concentration using the
         Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation [26]: eGFR = 141 × min(SCr/κ, 1)α × max(SCr/κ, 1)-1.209 × 0.993Age × 1.018 if female × 1.159 if black, where SCr is serum creatinine, κ is 0.7 for females
         and 0.9 for males, α is -0.329 for females and -0.411 for males, min indicates the
         minimum of SCr/κ or 1, and max indicates the maximum of SCr/κ or 1. CKD staging used
         a modification of National Kidney Foundation (NKF) criteria [1]: Stage 1, albuminuria with an eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2; Stage 2, albuminuria with an eGFR 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m2; Stage 3 was subdivided into Stage 3a, an eGFR 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m2, and Stage 3b, an eGFR 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m2; and Stage 4, an eGFR 15–29 mL/min/1.73 m2. Individuals with Stage 5 CKD (&lt;15 mL/min/1.73 m2) and those on dialysis were not included in the study due to the likelihood of confounding
         from the small number of individuals within these groups.
      
      Data collection and laboratory measurements
      All disease history and drug utilization was self-reported based on the NHANES questionnaire.
         CVD was a composite of self-reported CHD, stroke or congestive heart failure. CHD
         was identified by self-report of CHD, angina or myocardial infarction (MI). Presence
         of diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes was identified by self-report of diabetes, self-reported
         use of insulin or oral medications for diabetes, or a fasting plasma glucose ≥126
         mg/dL. Hyperlipidemia was defined as fasting levels of LDL-C above the specific goal
         for each CHD risk category designated in the National Cholesterol Education Program
         Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) guidelines [27] (LDL-C level ≥160 mg/dL for individuals with ≤1 CHD risk factor, ≥130 mg/dL for individuals
         with ≥2 CHD risk factors, and ≥100 mg/dL for individuals with a history of CHD or
         CHD risk equivalents), or self-reported use of lipid-lowering agents (including statins,
         fibric acid derivatives, bile acid sequestrants, cholesterol absorption inhibitors
         and other antihyperlipidemic agents). CHD risk factors included cigarette smoking,
         hypertension (BP ≥140/90 mmHg or on antihypertensive medication), low levels of high-density
         lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C; &lt;40 mg/dL), family history of premature CHD (male
         first-degree relative &lt;55 years; female first-degree relative &lt;65 years), and older
         age (men ≥45 years; women ≥55 years). CHD risk equivalents included diabetes and 2
         or more risk factors conferring a 10-year risk for CHD &gt;20%; information on non-coronary
         forms of atherosclerotic disease (peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm,
         and symptomatic carotid artery disease; also considered CHD risk equivalents) was
         not available in NHANES. BP measurements in NHANES were performed 3–4 times manually
         with a mercury sphygmomanometer according to a standard protocol [25]. The first reading was excluded and the remaining readings were used to compute average
         BP. Hypertension was defined as an average BP &gt;130 mmHg systolic or &gt;80 mmHg diastolic,
         or self-reported use of antihypertensive agents (including β-blockers, calcium channel
         blockers, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor
         blockers and other BP-lowering agents).
      
      Methods for quantifying measures of kidney damage and kidney function have been described
         elsewhere [25]. Briefly, urinary albumin was measured using a solid-phase fluorescent immunoassay.
         Urinary creatinine was measured by one of two methods: a Jaffé rate (kinetic alkaline
         picrate) method (prior to 2007) and an enzymatic (creatinase) method (from 2007 on).
         Serum creatinine was measured using the Jaffé rate method. Methods for determining
         blood lipid levels in NHANES have been described previously [25]. Briefly, total cholesterol was measured enzymatically on the basis of hydrogen peroxide
         generation. In 2001–2002, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was measured
         using two methods, heparin–manganese precipitation and a direct immunoassay, depending
         on the participant age and amount of specimen. From 2003, all HDL-C measurements used
         the direct immunoassay method. Triglyceride levels were measured after hydrolysis
         to glycerol. LDL-C levels were calculated from measured values of total cholesterol,
         triglycerides (≤400 mg/dL) and HDL-C according to the Friedewald calculation [25]. Plasma glucose was measured using a modified hexokinase enzymatic method [25].
      
      Definition of treatment goals
      Participants were classified as meeting current recommendations on LDL-C or BP treatment
         goals for patients with CKD [11,12] if their fasting LDL-C level was &lt;100 mg/dL or their BP was ≤130/80 mmHg. A sensitivity
         analysis to investigate the effect of increasing the threshold for BP goal attainment
         to ≤140/90 mmHg was also performed. In participants with CKD and concomitant CVD,
         or CKD and concomitant diabetes, attainment of the optional LDL-C goal of &lt;70 mg/dL
         [28-30] was also examined.
      
      Statistical methods
      Statistical analyses were performed using survey analysis procedures available in
         SAS software version 9.22 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina) that take into
         account the complex sampling scheme of NHANES, and used sampling weights to account
         for differential probabilities of sample selection and non-response. The fasting sampling
         weights of the 9,915 participants included in the analysis were adjusted to the July
         2008 US census population ≥20 years of age (n=221,419,638). Each 2-year fasting sample
         weight within an NHANES 2-year study cycle was multiplied by the 2008 US census count
         and divided by the 2-year weighted total sample count from the analysis data set of
         persons in the 2-year study cycle. The population sizes for each study cycle were
         180,717,445 for 2001–2002; 184,340,382 for 2003–2004; 190,068,016 for 2005–2006; 201,486,048
         for 2007–2008; and 203,258,815 for 2009–2010. For example, the fasting sampling weight
         for each study participant from 2001–2002 was multiplied by 221,419,638/180,717,445;
         the fasting sampling weight for each study participant from 2003–2004 was multiplied
         by 221,419,638/184,340,382; and so on for all 5 study periods. Demographic and clinical
         characteristics of the 2001–2010 NHANES participants with and without CKD were calculated
         using SURVEYFREQ. Rao-Scott chi-square P values for categorical variables were obtained using SURVEYFREQ. Between-cohort P values for continuous variables were obtained using SURVEYREG. Each continuous outcome
         was regressed on the indicator variable CKD=1 or No CKD=0, and a contrast statement
         was used to generate the between-cohort P value. Estimated population prevalences were calculated using SURVEYFREQ and stratified
         by CKD stage. P values for Stage 1 versus Stage 4 CKD were obtained using SURVEYLOGISTIC. Each outcome
         was regressed on the 5-level class variable CKD stage (Stage 1, 2, 3a, 3b or 4), and
         a contrast statement was used to generate the Stage 1 versus Stage 4 P value. Linear trends for utilization of lipid- and BP-lowering agents, and rates
         of LDL-C or BP goal attainment, over the five 2-year survey cycles were also assessed
         using SURVEYLOGISTIC, including time as a continuous variable. Statistical tests were
         2-sided and a P-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.
