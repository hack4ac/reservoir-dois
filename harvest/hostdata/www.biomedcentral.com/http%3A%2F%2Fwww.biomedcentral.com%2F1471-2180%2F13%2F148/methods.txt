      Bacterial growth conditions and virulence assays
      Bacterial strains used in this work are listed in Table&nbsp;1. B. cenocepacia strains were cultured at 37°C with shaking at 200&nbsp;rpm in NYG medium (5&nbsp;g peptone,
         3&nbsp;g yeast extract, and 20&nbsp;g glycerol per liter) [33]. The following antibiotics were supplemented when necessary: tetracycline, 100&nbsp;μg&nbsp;ml-1;
         ampicillin, 200&nbsp;μg&nbsp;ml-1; trimethoprim, 25&nbsp;μg&nbsp;ml-1. Killing assays were performed using
         Caenorhabditis elegans strain Bristol N2. Nematodes were maintained on nematode growth medium (NGM) at 23°C
         [34]. Slow killing assays were performed on NGM medium and fast killing assays on high-osmolarity
         PGS medium (peptone-glucose-sorbitol) [22]. BDSF and OHL signal molecules were added to the medium at a final concentration
         of 5&nbsp;μM unless indicated otherwise.

      Construction of in-frame deletion mutants and complementation strains
      The cepI deletion mutant of B. cenocepacia strain H111 was used as the parental strain to generate the in-frame double deletion
         mutant of rpfFBc and cepI, following the methods described previously [12]. For complementation analysis, the coding region of WspR was amplified by PCR using
         the primers listed in Additional file 4: Table S1, and cloned under the control of the S7 ribosomal protein promoter in plasmid
         vector pMSL7. The resultant construct was conjugated into the rpfFBc deletion mutant B. cenocepacia H111 using tri-parental mating with pRK2013 as the mobilizing plasmid.

      Construction of reporter strains and measurement of β-galactosidase activity
      The promoter of cepI was amplified using the primer pairs listed in Additional file 4: Table S1 with HindIII and XhoI restriction sites attached. The resulting products
         were digested with HindIII and XhoI, and ligated at the same enzyme sites in the vector
         pME2-lacZ [35]. These constructs, verified by DNA sequencing, were introduced into B. cenocepacia H111 using tri-parental mating with pRK2013. Transconjugants were then selected on
         LB agar plates supplemented with ampicillin and tetracycline. Bacterial cells were
         grown at 37°C and harvested at different time points as indicated, and measurement
         of β-galactosidase activities was performed following the methods as described previously
         [36].
      
      Biofilm formation, swarming motility and proteolytic activity assays
      Biofilm formation in 96-well polypropylene microtiter dishes was assayed essentially
         as described previously [23]. Swarming motility was determined on semi-solid agar (0.5%). Bacteria were inoculated
         into the center of plates containing 0.8% tryptone, 0.5% glucose, and 0.5% agar. The
         plates were incubated at 37°C for 18&nbsp;h before measurement of the colony diameters.
         Protease assay was performed following the previously described method [37]. Protease activity was obtained after normalization of absorbance against corresponding
         cell density.
      
      Analysis of AHL signals
      Bacterial cells were grown in NYG medium to a same cell density in the late growth
         phase. The supernatants were acidified to pH = 4.0 and extracted using ethyl acetate
         in a 1:1 ratio. Following evaporation of ethyl acetate the residues were dissolved
         in methanol. Quantification of AHL signals was performed using β-galactosidase assay
         with the aid of the AHL reporter strain CF11 as described previously [38]. Briefly, the reporter strain was grown in minimal medium at 28°C with shaking at
         220&nbsp;rpm overnight. The cultures were inoculated in the same medium supplemented with
         extracts containing AHL signals. Bacterial cells were harvested and β-galactosidase
         activities were assayed as described in previous section. For TLC analysis, 5&nbsp;μl of
         the concentrated AHL extracts were spotted onto 10 × 20&nbsp;cm RP-18254&nbsp;s plate (MERCK)
         and separated with methanol–water (60:40, v/v). The plates were subsequently air dried
         and overlaid with 50&nbsp;ml minimal medium containing 0.8% agarose, 50&nbsp;μg&nbsp;ml-1 X-gal,
         and 1&nbsp;ml stocked CF11 culture. The plates were then incubated overnight at 28°C, and
         AHL is indicated by the presence of a blue spot.
      
      Western blotting analysis
      Bacterial cultures were grown in NYG medium overnight and inoculated in the same medium.
         The refreshed cultures were grown at 37°C to an OD600 of 4.5; and 1&nbsp;ml of each bacterial culture was collected and centrifuged. The cells
         were lysed by adding 250&nbsp;μl celLyticTM B cell Lysis Reagent (Sigma). The concentrations
         of total protein samples were measured and normalized. Then the samples were denatured
         by boiling for 10&nbsp;min and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed
         following the standard protocols [39].
