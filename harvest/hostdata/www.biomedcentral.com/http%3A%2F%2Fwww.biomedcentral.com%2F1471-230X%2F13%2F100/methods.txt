      Preparation of L. acidophilus CRL 1014 cells
      
      At weekly intervals, a pure culture of L. acidophilus CRL 1014 (CERELA, San Miguel de Tucumán, Argentina) was inoculated into De Man, Rogosa
         and Sharpe (MRS) broth (Acumedia, Baltimore, USA). Cultures were harvested during
         the exponential growth, after, they were centrifuged (4000 × g, 10&nbsp;min, 4°C) and washed
         with sterile peptone water. The L. acidophilus CRL1014 cells were kept at the concentration of 108&nbsp;CFU/mL in sterile peptone water until use [17].
      
      Long-term SHIME® run
      
      The SHIME® is a simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem [18,19] in which environmental conditions (pH, residence time, inoculum, and temperature)
         are controlled to resemble those found in vivo. A SHIME® system consists of five double-jacketed vessels, simulating the stomach, the small
         intestine, and the ascending, transverse and descending colon, with a total retention
         time of 72&nbsp;h (Additional file 1: Figure S1). The reactor setup and the composition of the liquid feed (Table&nbsp;1), which entered the system three times per day, were previously described by Possemiers
         et al. [14].

      Table 1. Ingredients (g) employed for each liter of the basal feed used in the Shime reactor
      The three colon vessels of the SHIME® reactor were inoculated with bacteria from a fecal sample of a healthy 22-year-old
         adult female with no history of antibiotic treatment 6&nbsp;months prior to the study.
         Aliquots (10&nbsp;g) of fresh fecal samples were diluted and homogenized with 100&nbsp;mL of
         sterilized phosphate buffer (0.1&nbsp;mol/L, pH&nbsp;7), containing 1&nbsp;g/L sodium thioglycolate
         as the reducing agent.
      
      The microbial inoculum was stabilized over a period of 2-wk on a carbohydrate-based
         medium and allowed to adapt to the specific environmental conditions of the ascending,
         transverse and descending colon, in terms of pH range, retention time and available
         carbon sources [14,15]. Upon stabilization, the SHIME® run included 2- wk of basal period (to quantify all steady-state bacterial parameters
         which were used as starting point to evaluate the effect of a specific treatment),
         and a 4-wk of treatment period, in which 5&nbsp;mL of 108&nbsp;CFU/mL of L. acidophilus CRL 1014 were added once per day to the stomach compartment. Finally, a 2-week washout
         period without the addition of L. acidophilus CRL 1014 was observed.
      
      Microbiological analysis
      At weekly intervals, throughout the entire experimental period, (basal, treatment
         and washout), 5&nbsp;mL samples were collected from the reactors for microbiological examinations.
         The analysis of the intestinal microbiota composition was based on the enumeration
         of total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, Enterococcus spp., Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., enterobacteria, and Clostridium spp. One mL of a sample taken from each reactor was suspended in 99&nbsp;mL of peptone
         water. Serial dilutions were prepared and inoculated into selective culture media,
         as follows: total aerobic and anaerobic counts: Standard Methods agar (Acumedia, Baltimore,
         USA; 37°C/48&nbsp;h); Enterococcus spp.: KF Streptococcus agar (Acumedia, Baltimore, USA; 37°C/48&nbsp;h) [16]; Lactobacillus spp.: MRS agar (Merck, Germany; 37°C/48&nbsp;h, under anaerobiosis). For Bifidobacterium spp. counts was used the Bifidobacterium formulated medium BIM-25 (Difco, France;
         37°C/72&nbsp;h, Anaerobic System, Probac, Brazil) according Munoa &amp; Pares [20], Enterobacteria: MacConkey agar (Acumedia, Baltimore, USA; 37°C/48&nbsp;h) and Clostridium spp.: RCA Agar (Difco, France; 37°C/48&nbsp;h, Anaerobic System, Probac, Brazil) [21].
      
      Analysis of short-chain fatty acids and ammonium
      Once a week, throughout the entire experimental period (basal, treatment and washout),
         samples were collected from the reactors for analysis SCFA and ammonium. The analysis
         was carried out in triplicates.
      
      Every week, the levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were determined from samples
         collected from the reactors and frozen to -20°C. The SCFA were extracted with diethyl
         ether and determined using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame-ionization gas
         detector, a capillary split/splitless injector and an HP-INNOWAX column with a 30&nbsp;m
         × 0.25&nbsp;mm × 0.25&nbsp;μm inlet (Shimadzu GC2010), using hydrogen as the carrier gas at
         a flow rate of 1.56&nbsp;mL/min. The temperatures of the column, injector and detector
         were 170, 250 and 280°C, respectively [22].
      
      The ammonia content was determined using a selective ion meter (710A model, Orion)
         coupled to an ammonia selective-ion electrode (Orion 95–12). The apparatus was calibrated
         using 0.1&nbsp;M standard ammonium chloride solutions, at the concentrations of 10, 100,
         and 1000&nbsp;mg/L of ammonia. To every 25&nbsp;mL of sample, 0.5&nbsp;mL of ISA solution (Ionic
         Strength Adjuster, Orion – a pH-adjusting and ionic force solution) was added. All
         measurements were carried out at 25°C [23].
      
      Composition of the Lactobacillus community
      
      DNA was extracted from 2&nbsp;mL of sample using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen,
         Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA yield was quantified
         using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Willmington, USA).
      
      DGGE analysis
      The diversity of the Lactobacillus community in samples taken throughout model operation was assessed by DGGE. To prevent
         a low amplicon yield a nested PCR approach was used as previously described [24]. This involved a first round of PCR with primers Bact27f (5′-GTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′)
         [25] and 1492R (5′- CGG CTA CCT TGT TAC GAC-3′) [26], followed by a second PCR with primers Lab159f (5′-GGAAACAGATGCTAATACCG-3′) and Lab677-GCr
         (5′-GCCCGGGGCGCGCCCCGGGCGGGGCGGGGGCACGGGGGGGCACCGCTACACATGGAG-3′) [24].
      
      PCR was performed using the GoTaq® Green Master Mix kit (Promega, USA). Samples were amplified in a Veriti® 96-Well Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, USA) by using the following program:
         initial denaturation at 94°C for 2&nbsp;min; 35&nbsp;cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30&nbsp;s,
         annealing at primer-specific temperature for 40&nbsp;s, elongation at 72°C for primer-specific
         time, and extension at 72°C for 5&nbsp;min, followed by a final cooling to 4°C. The annealing
         temperature and elongation time was set at 52°C/1.30&nbsp;min with primers Bact27f and
         1492r and 60°C/1&nbsp;min with primers Lab159f and Lab677-GCr. The PCR products that were
         used as templates in nested PCR were purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit
         (Qiagen, USA).
      
      DGGE analysis of PCR amplicons was based on the protocol described by Muyzer et al.
         [27] by using the DCode System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercμles, CA, USA). Electrophoresis
         was done as described previously [24] in an 8% polyacrylamide gel with a denaturant gradient of 30–50% (100% was defined
         as 40% formamide and 7&nbsp;M urea) for 16&nbsp;h at 85&nbsp;V in a 0.5× TAE buffer at a constant
         temperature of 60°C. Gels were stained with silver nitrate by the method of Sanguinetti
         et al. [28], scanned at 400 d.p.i., and further analyzed by the BioNumerics 6.0 software (Applied
         Maths). The distance matrices of each DGGE based on the Pearson correlation similarity
         coefficient to cluster the samples was analyzed using the BioNumerics software (Applied
         Maths).
      
      Bands of interest in the lactobacilli community fingerprint were excised from the
         gel and transferred into 25&nbsp;μl of TE buffer, and incubated overnight at 37°C to allow
         diffusion of the DNA. Two microliters of the eluted DNA were used for reamplification
         with the GC-clamped primer by using the conditions described above and the PCR products
         generated were checked by DGGE. Only PCR products which yielded a single band and
         comigrated with the original band were purified by the QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen,
         USA) and were subjected to DNA sequence analysis at the genomic facilities of The
         Human Genome Research Center (HGRC), at the University of São Paulo. BLAST searches
         were performed to determine the closest known relatives of the partial rRNA gene sequence
         obtained in GenBank.
      
      Nucleotide sequence accession numbers
      The sequences of the 16S rDNA fragments were deposited in the GenBank database. The
         accession numbers of the 4 sequences are as follows (band code in parentheses): KF054352
         (lac1), KF054351 (lac2), KF054353 (lac3) and KF054350 (lac4).
      
      Statistical analysis
      The significance of all results was investigated with one-way ANOVA, and individual
         means were compared using the Tukey’s test (p &lt; 0.01), using the statistical software
         Sigma Stat 5.0.
