Methods
   
      Data sources
      We analysed 38,439 cases diagnosed with first, primary, invasive malignant tumour
         of the following cancers: stomach (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision code [13]: C16), colorectal (C18-C20), lung (C33, C34), breast (C50, female only) and prostate
         (C61) from 1990–2004. They were followed up between 2000 and 2004 in Osaka, Japan,
         from the Osaka Cancer Registry database. We limited the data to patients who were
         diagnosed at age 15 to 69 years. Patients over 70 years of age at diagnosis were excluded
         from the analyses as long-term survival estimates are unstable for older age groups.
         In the Osaka Cancer Registry, we followed patients up using the death certificate
         database for residents in Osaka prefecture. However, if patients had moved outside
         the Osaka Prefecture after diagnosis the death certificate database would be unable
         to capture their details. In these cases resident registries were used to follow the
         patients up. Residents in Osaka-city (30% of total population of Osaka prefecture)
         were not followed-up using residence registries before 1993, so patients who lived
         in Osaka-city were excluded from the analysis. Cases diagnosed from 1990 to 1999 were
         followed up for 10 years after diagnosis, whereas follow-up was limited to 5 years
         for those diagnosed from 2000 to 2004 (Figure&nbsp;1).

      Statistical analysis
      First, we estimated ten-year relative survival using the Osaka Cancer Registry data
         by sex, age group (15–49, 50–59 and 60–69 years old) and stage at diagnosis (localised,
         regional and distant metastasis). Relative survival is a ratio of the observed survival
         (overall survival) and the survival that would have been expected if the cancer patient
         had only experienced the normal (background) mortality of the general population in
         which they live [14]. In this study we estimated relative survival using the maximum likelihood method
         developed by Esteve et al. [15] and the publicly available Stata programme strel[16]. We derived the expected survival from complete (single-year-of-age) national population
         life tables by sex [17]. We used conventional 10-year relative survival estimating based on data from patients
         who were diagnosed from1995-1999 and were followed-up over 10 years (dashed line in
         Figure&nbsp;1). However, calculation of long-term survival using the conventional method is outdated.
         We therefore used period analysis to derive more up-to-date long-term survival using
         data from recently followed-up cancer patients [18]. In this study, we used data from cancer patients who were diagnosed from 1990–2004
         and followed-up between 2000 and 2004 (solid black line, in Figure&nbsp;1).
      
      Second, we calculated conditional five-year survival for patients who survived for
         0 to 5 years after diagnosis using ten-year cumulative relative survival. To estimate
         the five-year conditional survival of patients who survived x years, the (x + 5)-year
         cumulative survival rates is divided by the x-year cumulative survival. In the other
         words, conditional five-year survival is five-year survival of the patients who are
         alive several years after diagnosis [2,10].
      
      Third, for missing stage cases, we used the multiple imputation approach [19]. We examined the characteristics of patients with missing stage before multiple imputation,
         then we assumed the mechanism of missingness as Missing At Random. The relative survival
         of the ten completed data sets contained the imputed value of stage for cases with
         missing information (6.4-17.1%). The imputation model was a multinomial logistic regression
         including follow-up time, vital status, period of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, and
         interactions between follow-up time and other factors. Rubin’s rules were applied
         to estimate relative survival and standard errors combining the ten completed data
         sets. All statistical analyses were performed using the standard statistical package
         Stata Ver. 12.1 [20].
