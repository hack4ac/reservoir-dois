Methods
   
      Data sources and search strategy
      We conducted a systematic review of the prevalence and incidence of HCV in the different
         population groups in Egypt following the PRISMA guidelines [8]. The PRISMA checklist can be found in Table S1, see Additional file 1. The main data sources for this investigation were: PubMed (Medline) and Embase databases.
         The above data sources were searched with no time or language restrictions. PubMed
         and Embase were searched using both MeSH/Emtree terms, respectively, and text terms. MeSH/Emtree terms were exploded to cover all subheadings. Details of the search criteria for
         each of these databases can be found below:

      Ethics statement
      Our study did not need an ethics committee approval or written informed consent because
         it relies entirely on published data.
      
      Study selection
      The results of the searches were imported to a reference manager, Endnote, where duplicate
         publications were identified and excluded. The remaining unique and potentially relevant
         records were then imported into Microsoft Excel where screening for relevance and
         eligibility took place. The titles and abstracts of all records retrieved were screened
         for relevance independently by two of the authors (YM and SR). Screening for relevance
         was conducted in two stages: 1) Stage 1 involved screening all titles and abstracts
         to exclude all non-relevant articles; 2) Stage 2 involved retrieving and screening
         the full-text of all articles deemed relevant after the initial abstract screening,
         to further exclude any remaining non-eligible articles. Inconsistencies between reviewers
         were discussed and sorted out by consensus.
      
      A publication was considered eligible for inclusion in the review if it had data on
         at least one of the following outcomes of interest: 1) prevalence of HCV as detected
         by HCV antibodies; and 2) incidence of HCV as detected by HCV antibodies. Only studies
         reporting primary data were included. Reviews of literature were excluded, but all
         data reported were checked and compared to the results of our search. Any additional
         study identified in the excluded review and not retrieved by our search was identified
         and added to our review. Case reports and case series were excluded. All other study
         designs were eligible for inclusion. Distinction was made between the number of “reports”
         (actual publications i.e. papers, conference abstracts etc.) and the number of “studies”
         (actual study and research project). Multiple reports of the same study were identified
         as duplicates and counted as one study.
      
      Eligible studies were then categorized into two types: prevalence studies and incidence
         studies. Any article reporting both the prevalence and incidence of HCV was counted
         as two studies, one for incidence and one for prevalence. Results were then pooled
         into one list containing all eligible and unique studies.
      
      Data extraction and population classification
      The following data were then extracted from each eligible study included in the review:
         author, year of data collection, year of publication, city, study site, study design,
         sampling technique, population (blood donors, barbers, health care workers, injecting
         drug users (IDUs) etc.), socio-demographic characteristics of the population (sex,
         age, rural vs. urban etc.), sample size, and prevalence and/or incidence of HCV. Although
         our search criteria did not specifically target publications reporting HCV RNA prevalence
         or risk factors in Egypt, we extracted this information from eligible publications
         when available. Risk factors were extracted only if they were statistically significant
         in a multivariate regression analysis within a study that was found relevant according
         to our search criteria.
      
      Data on the above mentioned indicators were extracted from included records and entered
         into a computerized database on Microsoft Excel. Extracted data were then classified
         and analyzed on the basis of the study population’s risk of acquiring HCV. The four
         defined major population risk groups are:
      
      1) Populations at direct or high risk: this group includes IDUs, multi-transfused
         patients such as hemophiliacs and thalassemics, dialysis patients, and viral hepatitis
         patients, among others.
      
      2) Populations at indirect or intermediate risk: this group includes familial contacts of HCV patients i.e. their children, spouses, and other household contacts; select
         practitioners of professions at risk of HCV such as dentists, healthcare workers and barbers; populations with potential IDU exposures including: prisoners and HIV patients; and populations with health facility/injecting exposures such as diabetic patients and hospitalized populations.
      
      3) General population groups (populations which are not at an elevated risk of HCV
         exposure): pregnant women, blood donors, children, rural populations, army recruits
         or fire brigade personnel, outpatient clinic attendees, populations defined in case–control
         studies as healthy populations (controls), among other groups categorized together
         as “other general population” groups.
      
      4) Special clinical population groups such as Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) patients, lichen
         planus (LP), and liver disease patients, among others. This category includes patients
         with specific diseases that require clinical care, and thus can be exposed to HCV
         in medical care facilities, though at variable levels of risk that is difficult to
         categorize among any of the above mentioned population groups.
      
      Within any specific category of the above population groups, considerable heterogeneity
         and different subgroup trends may exist.
      
      In order to create prevalence figures, HCV prevalence measures within each of the
         population groups above were stratified into two strata: pre-2001 and post-2001, based
         on the year in which the study was conducted. The year 2001 was chosen as the cut-off
         year, as this was the year in which the Egyptian Ministry of Health initiated broad
         infection control programs in the country [9].
      
      Time trend analysis
      We conducted a time trend analysis investigating the change in HCV prevalence among
         the general population and high risk population in Egypt with respect to time. We
         started by conducting univariate linear regression analyses examining the change in
         HCV prevalence over time in each of the general population subgroups separately. A
         similar analysis was conducted in each of the high risk population subgroups. To avoid
         systematic biases in any one subgroup and to increase the statistical power of the
         time trend analysis, we also used a multivariate linear regression model estimating
         the temporal trend in HCV prevalence, while adjusting for the different subgroups
         in each population grouping. Two such models were performed: one for the general population
         and the other for the high-risk population. Mean HCV prevalence was modeled using
         a model that includes as predictors: time (in years) and the different general population
         subgroups (or high risk population subgroups).
      
      The general population regression model stipulates that:

         this review. In the presence of both an overall HCV prevalence measure as well as
         stratified prevalence measures, we included only the overall prevalence measure. Including
         both overall and stratified prevalence measures from the same study would have given
         more weight to those studies, relative to others, thereby biasing our results. The
         year of data collection was estimated for studies missing this variable. This was
         done by conducting a correlation analysis between the year of data collection and
         the year of publication for studies having data on both, followed by a paired t-test
         to estimate the mean difference between them. We then applied this difference to the
         year of publication to estimate the year of data collection when missing. Midpoints
         were calculated and used for studies conducted over a number of years. The statistical
         analysis was conducted using STATA version 11 (STATA corporation, College Station,
         Texas).
