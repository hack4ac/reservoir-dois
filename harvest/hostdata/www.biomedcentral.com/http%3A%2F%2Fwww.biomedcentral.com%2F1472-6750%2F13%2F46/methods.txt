Methods
   
      Plasmid, bacterial strain and culture media
      The plasmid pET303/CT-His and the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). The bacterial
         cells were cultivated in LB medium (10&nbsp;g/L peptone, 5&nbsp;g/L yeast extract, 5&nbsp;g/L NaCl,
         pH&nbsp;7.0). The effect of Terrific broth (TB; 12&nbsp;g/L tryptone, 24&nbsp;g/L yeast extract,
         4&nbsp;mL/L glycerol, 2.31&nbsp;g/L KH2PO4 and 12.54&nbsp;g/L K2HPO4) on the level of recombinant protein expression was also verified.
      
      Sequence analysis
      Searches for homologous proteins on public sequence databases were performed using
         BLASTp [65]. Signal peptide and signal peptidase cleavage sites were predicted using SignalP
         version 3.0 [66]. The theoretical isoelectric point (pI) and molecular weight (Mw) were predicted
         using Compute pI/Mw on the ExPASy Proteomics Server [67]. The presence and delimitation of protein domains was accomplished using the Conserved
         Domain Database (CDD) [68]. Multiple amino acid sequence alignments were generated using ClustalW [69]. The identity between a pair of aligned sequences was calculated as the number of
         identical residues divided by the number of aligned positions, excluding the sites
         with gaps, and expressed as a percentage. Structural alignments based on comparisons
         of 3D structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) were obtained from the Dali
         database [70]. The functional domains were named following the nomenclature adopted by the Carbohydrate-Active
         enZymes (CAZy) database [71].
      
      Amplification and cloning
      Genomic DNA from C. violaceum ATCC 12472 was isolated using a CTAB-based protocol as described previously [72]. The complete DNA sequence of the CV2935 ORF was amplified by PCR using the bacterial
         genomic DNA as a template. The design of the PCR primers was based on the coding sequence
         of the corresponding ORF, which spans the C. violaceum chromosome from position 3,211,716 to 3,213,035 [GenBank accession number: NC_005085].
         The primer sequences were 5’-CCGTCTAGAATGCGCAGAACGACAGGCAGG-3’ (forward) and 5’-CCGCTCGAGCCAGGCCGTCCGCGTCGCGCG-3’ (reverse). Restriction endonuclease sites (underlined) were
         incorporated in the forward (XbaI) and reverse (XhoI) primers, respectively, to allow for further manipulation of the PCR products. Amplifications
         were carried out in a final volume of 20&nbsp;μL containing 50&nbsp;ng genomic DNA, 1X Buffer
         Phusion GC (Finnzymes, Vantaa, Finland), 1.5&nbsp;mM MgCl2, 200&nbsp;μM of each dNTP, 0.5&nbsp;μM of each primer, and 0.4 U Phusion Hot Start High-Fidelity
         DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes). Amplification reactions were performed in a Mastercycler
         Gradient Thermo Cycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) using the following cycling parameters:
         an initial denaturation step (3&nbsp;min at 98°C) followed by 35&nbsp;cycles of 10&nbsp;s at 98°C,
         30&nbsp;s at 65°C, and 2.5&nbsp;min at 72°C. After the last cycle, the reactions were further
         incubated for 5&nbsp;min at 72°C. The amplified product was verified by analyzing a 5-μL
         aliquot of the PCR reactions by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis [73]. PCR products were purified from the remaining solution using the illustra GFX PCR
         DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK), digested with
         XbaI and XhoI (Fermentas Life Sciences, Ontario, Canada) and purified again using the same kit.
         The PCR products were then ligated into the pET303/CT-His vector, which was previously
         digested with the same restriction enzymes, using T4 DNA Ligase (Promega, Madison,
         WI, USA). The ligation products were introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells by electroporation, and the transformants were selected on LB agar
         containing 100&nbsp;μg/mL carbenicillin. Plasmid DNA was isolated from antibiotic-resistant
         colonies using the alkaline lysis method [73], and the presence of the insert was confirmed by PCR and restriction digestion with
         the appropriate endonucleases. In the recombinant plasmid, designated pET-CV2935,
         the chitinase coding sequence was cloned in frame with a C-terminal polyhistidine
         (6xHis) tag and its expression was under the control of the T7lac promoter.
      
      Protein expression and purification
      A single isolated colony of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring the recombinant plasmid pET-CV2935, which were grown on
         LB agar supplemented with 100&nbsp;μg/mL carbenicillin, was selected and inoculated in
         5&nbsp;mL LB containing the same antibiotic. The culture was incubated with vigorous shaking
         (180&nbsp;rpm) at 37°C for 16&nbsp;h. An aliquot (500&nbsp;μL) of this culture was then inoculated
         into 50&nbsp;mL LB (in a 500&nbsp;mL Erlenmeyer flask) supplemented with 100&nbsp;μg/mL carbenicillin
         and further incubated as before until the OD600 reached 0.4-0.5. Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final
         concentration of 0.5&nbsp;mM to induce the expression of the recombinant protein. After
         24&nbsp;h at 37°C, the culture was centrifuged (6,000 g, 10&nbsp;min, 4°C), the cell pellet was saved for further analysis and the supernatant
         (i.e., the medium free of cells) was dialyzed against distilled water. To the dialyzed
         supernatant, solid ammonium sulfate was added to 95% saturation, and the mixture was
         incubated at room temperature for approximately 20&nbsp;h. The precipitated proteins (F0/95)
         were collected by centrifugation (15,000 g, 20&nbsp;min, 4°C) and resuspended in 50&nbsp;mM sodium acetate (NaAc) buffer (pH&nbsp;5.2) containing
         1&nbsp;M NaCl. The mixture was incubated for 3&nbsp;h at 4°C, and the insoluble materials were
         then removed by centrifugation (15,000 g, 20&nbsp;min, 4°C). The clear supernatant was loaded onto a chitin column (1.5 × 16&nbsp;cm),
         which was prepared from practical grade chitin from crab shells (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
         Louis, MO, USA). The chitin was equilibrated with 50&nbsp;mM NaAc buffer (pH&nbsp;5.2) containing
         1&nbsp;M NaCl, and the protein sample was loaded onto the matrix and incubated for 16&nbsp;h
         at 4°C. Unbound proteins were eluted by washing the column with the equilibration
         buffer, and the adsorbed proteins were recovered by elution with 0.1&nbsp;M acetic acid.
         Fractions with an A280 greater than 0.050 were pooled and dialyzed against distilled water. The dialyzed
         material was centrifuged (12,000 g, 10&nbsp;min, 4°C) and concentrated by ultrafiltration using a 30-kDa cut-off membrane
         (Vivaspin 20, GE Healthcare).
      
      Osmotic shock and cell lysis
      Periplasmic proteins expressed in E. coli cells harboring the plasmid pET-CV2935 were obtained by the osmotic shock (OS) protocol
         described by Koshland and Botstein [74], with minor modifications. Briefly, the cells were resuspended in OS solution 1 [20&nbsp;mM
         Tris-HCl (pH&nbsp;8.0), 2.5&nbsp;mM EDTA, 20% (w/v) sucrose] to an OD550 = 5.0, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 10&nbsp;min and centrifuged (6,000 g, 10&nbsp;min, 4°C). The buffer was decanted, and the cells were resuspended in OS solution
         2 [20&nbsp;mM Tris-HCl (pH&nbsp;8.0), 2.5&nbsp;mM EDTA] using the same volume as before. The cell
         suspension was again incubated on ice for 10&nbsp;min and centrifuged (6,000 g, 10&nbsp;min, 4°C), and the supernatant (shock fluid fraction) was transferred to a clean
         tube and stored at −20°C. The remaining cells were lysed by resuspending them in lysis
         buffer (50&nbsp;mM Tris-HCl, pH&nbsp;8.0, 2&nbsp;mM EDTA, 0.15&nbsp;M NaCl) containing 100&nbsp;μg/mL lysozyme
         and 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v). The suspension was incubated at 30°C for 30&nbsp;min in a
         water bath, and the bacterial genomic DNA was then digested at 30°C for 30&nbsp;min using
         DNase I (Promega) in the presence of 8&nbsp;mM MgCl2 and 10&nbsp;mM CaCl2. The lysate was centrifuged (12,000 g for 30&nbsp;min at 4°C) and the supernatant, which was saved as the soluble intracellular
         extract, was kept at −20°C until use.
      
      Chitinolytic activity assays
      Chitinolytic activity was determined by the colorimetric method described by Boller
         [75] using colloidal chitin as a substrate. Colloidal chitin was prepared according to
         Molano et al. [76] using non-radioactive acetic anhydride. In this assay, the hydrolytic activity of
         the chitinase releases water-soluble oligomers from colloidal chitin, and in a second
         reaction, these oligosaccharides are cleaved to GlcNAc by a β-glucuronidase [77]. The protein sample [250&nbsp;μL, diluted in 50&nbsp;mM NaAc buffer (pH&nbsp;5.2)] was added to
         250&nbsp;μL of 10&nbsp;g/L colloidal chitin, and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 1&nbsp;h.
         The reaction was quenched by boiling for 5&nbsp;min in a water bath and then centrifuged
         (10,000 g, 25°C, 15&nbsp;min), and 300&nbsp;μL of the supernatant was transferred to a clean microcentrifuge
         tube containing 10&nbsp;μL assay buffer [50&nbsp;mM NaAc buffer (pH&nbsp;5.2)] or 10&nbsp;μL of 10 U/mL
         β-glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.31) type HP-2 (Sigma-Aldrich). Reactions were further incubated
         at 37°C for 1&nbsp;h, boiled for 5&nbsp;min and cooled on ice. Assay buffer (190&nbsp;μL) and 100&nbsp;μL
         0.6&nbsp;M potassium tetraborate were added, and the reaction mixture boiled again for
         5&nbsp;min and cooled on ice for 3&nbsp;min. Next, 1.0&nbsp;mL of 5% (w/v) p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (DMAB, Sigma-Aldrich) prepared in 0.7&nbsp;M HCl (diluted in
         100% acetic acid) was added, and the absorbance at 585&nbsp;nm was determined. The amount
         of GlcNAc released was estimated from a standard curve prepared with varying concentrations
         (100-600 μM) of GlcNAc [78]. Chitinase activity was expressed in units (U), and 1 U was defined as the amount
         of enzyme that released 1&nbsp;nmol of GlcNAc/mL/h at 37°C. Substrate specificity was also
         investigated using chromogenic analogues of N-acetyl chitooligossacharides as substrates. The following synthetic p-nitrophenyl-labeled oligomers of GlcNAc were used: p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine (pNP-GlcNAc), p-nitrophenyl-β-D-N,N’-diacetylchitobiose [pNP-(GlcNAc)2] and p-nitrophenyl-β-D-N,N’-,N”-triacetylchitotriose [pNP-(GlcNAc)3] (Sigma-Aldrich). Hydrolytic activity was determined by measuring the release of
         pNP from the substrates [79] according to the procedure supplied by the compounds’ manufacturer. The purified
         chitinase (10&nbsp;μL; 150&nbsp;ng protein/μL distilled water) was mixed with 90&nbsp;μL of 1&nbsp;mg/mL
         substrate solution, and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30&nbsp;min. The reaction
         was quenched by adding 200&nbsp;μL of 0.4&nbsp;M sodium carbonate, and the A405 of the p-nitrophenylate ion was measured. One unit of hydrolytic activity was defined as the
         amount of enzyme releasing 1&nbsp;nmol of p-nitrophenol/mL/h at 37°C.
      
      Soluble protein content
      The concentration of soluble protein in the bacterial culture samples and the fractions
         obtained during protein purification was determined using the Bradford method [80] with bovine serum albumin as a standard.
      
      SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting
      Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)
         and β-mercaptoethanol (SDS-PAGE) was performed as described by Laemmli [81] using 15% slab gels. Samples were prepared in 0.0625&nbsp;M Tris-HCl (pH&nbsp;6.8) containing
         2% (w/v) SDS, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol and 0.001% (w/v) bromophenol
         blue. Protein bands were stained with 0.2% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 in
         50% methanol/10% acetic acid for 16&nbsp;h. Destaining was carried out with 12.5% isopropanol/10%
         acetic acid. Alternatively, staining of the protein bands was performed using Simply
         Blue Safe Stain (Invitrogen) following the supplied protocol. Western blotting was
         performed according to the method of Towbin et al. [82]. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C
         Extra, GE Healthcare) and submitted to immunodetection using mouse IgG anti-His6 (Roche
         Applied Science, Germany) and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase
         (Santa Cruz Biotechnolgy, Dallas, USA).
      
      N-terminal amino acid sequencing
      N-terminal amino acid sequencing was carried out on a Shimadzu PPSQ-10 Automated Protein
         Sequencer (Kyoto, Japan). Protein samples were blotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride
         (PVDF) membrane after SDS-PAGE and submitted to Edman degradation [83]. The phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) amino acids were detected at 269&nbsp;nm after separation
         on a reversed phase C18 column (4.6&nbsp;mm × 2.5&nbsp;mm) under isocratic conditions, according
         to the manufacturer’s instructions.
      
      Effects of pH, temperature and metal ions on enzyme activity
      To determine the effect of pH on enzyme stability, a solution of chitinase (150&nbsp;ng/μL
         distilled water) was dialyzed for 1&nbsp;h with continuous stirring against five buffer
         systems (each at 50&nbsp;mM): glycine-HCl (pH&nbsp;2.0 and 3.0), sodium acetate (pH&nbsp;4.0 and
         5.0), sodium phosphate (pH&nbsp;6.0 and 7.0), Tris-HCl (pH&nbsp;8.0) and glycine-NaOH (pH&nbsp;9.0
         and 10.0). The dialyzed samples were diluted 1:20 (v/v) with the respective buffers,
         and the residual chitinase activity was determined under standard assay conditions.
         The effect of temperature on enzyme stability was assessed by incubating the protein
         (150&nbsp;ng/μL distilled water) at different temperatures (30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90
         and 100°C) for 30&nbsp;min in a water bath. After the heat treatment, the samples were
         stored at −20°C until the remaining chitinase activity was measured using standard
         assay conditions. For both factors, the relative activity was expressed as a percentage
         of the highest activity recorded at a certain pH or temperature, respectively. The
         effect of ions [Ba2+ (BaCl4), Ca2+ (CaCl2), Cu2+ (CuSO4), Fe2+ (FeSO4), K+ (KCl), Mg2+ (MgCl2), Mn2+ (MnCl2), NH4+ (NH4Cl), Ni2+ (NiCl) and Zn2+ (ZnSO4)], enzyme inhibitors (EDTA and β-mercaptoethanol) and a protein denaturant (SDS)
         on the enzymatic activity was investigated using pNP-(GlcNAc)2 and pNP-(GlcNAc)3 as substrates. The assay was carried out under standard conditions, including the
         ion (5&nbsp;mM), or the inhibitor [EDTA (5&nbsp;mM) or β-mercaptoethanol (5%&nbsp;v/v) or SDS (0.5,
         1.0 and 2.0%&nbsp;w/v)] to be tested in the reaction mixture. The residual hydrolytic activity
         was determined and expressed as a percentage of the activity recorded in the absence
         of ions or enzyme inhibitors.
