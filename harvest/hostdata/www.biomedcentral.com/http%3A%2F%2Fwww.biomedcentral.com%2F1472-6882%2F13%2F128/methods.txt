      Preparation of TLBZT
      The herbs used in TLBZT formula (Chinese patent ZL200910197565.2) are the roots of
         Actinidia chinensis (Teng-Li-Geng) 30 g, Solanum nigrum (Long-Kui) 15 g, Duchesnea indica (She-Mei) 15 g, Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz (Bai-Zhu) 9 g, Poria cocos (Fu-Ling) 15 g, Coix seed (Yi-Yi-Ren) 30 g, Mistletoe (Hu-Ji-Sheng) 15 g, and Scutellaria barbata (Ban-Zhi-Lian) 30 g. All those herbs were from the herb store in Longhua Hospital
         according to the original proportion, and decocted twice with 8-fold volume of distilled
         water for 1 hour. The decoction were collected, filtered, merged and concentrated
         to 1.5 g/mL (equivalent to crude herb materials), and stored at 4°C.
      
      For Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis, TLBZT were further extracted
         with dichloromethane and diethyl ether, and passed through 0.22 μm filter. GC/MS analysis
         of TLBZT extract was performed by GCMS6800 (Skyray Instrument, Jiangsu, China) equipped
         with a DB-5ms column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) (Agilent technologies, CA). Helium
         was used as carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min. An injection volume of
         1 μL was employed in splitless mode. Injector and ion-source were maintained at 280°C
         and 230°C, respectively. The mass-scan range was 50–500. The GC/MS profile of TLBZT
         is presented in Additional file 1: Figure S1.

      Cell culture and animal model
      Murine colon carcinoma CT26 cells were obtained from obtained from Cell Bank of Type
         Culture Collection of Chinese Academy of Sciences. CT26 cells were grown in DMEM medium
         with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 μg/mL) and maintained at
         37°C with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Female (6–7 weeks old) BALB/c mice (obtained from Shanghai
         SLAC Laboratory animal center) were acclimated for one week and were fed with animal
         chow and water ad libitum in SPF animal laboratory of Longhua Hospital.
      
      The mice were injected s.c. with 1 × 106 CT26 cells in 100 μl PBS in the right flank. When the tumors were palpable, the mice
         were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=10 mice/group), and intragastric administered
         with TLBZT (22.5 g/kg/0.3 ml, equivalent to crude herb materials, once a day) or same
         volume of distilled water, or i.p. administered with 5-FU (30 mg/kg/0.3 ml, once a
         week), or treated with both TLBZT and 5-Fu. Tumor width (W) and length (L) were measured
         every 3 days by calipers. The tumor volume (Tv) was calculated according to the formula:
         Tv = 0.52 × L × W2. After three weeks of treatment, the mice were sacrificed, and the tumors were removed,
         weighed and subjected to further experiments. All studies involving mice were approved
         by the Longhua Hospital Animal Care and Use Committee.
      
      TUNEL assay
      Apoptotic cells were identified by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated
         nick end labeling) assay following the manufacturer’s guide. Images were captured
         by the Olympus microscope at ×200 magnification. The apoptotic cells were counted
         by Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software.
      
      Caspases activities assay
      The activities of Caspases were detected by Caspase-3, 8 and 9 Activity Assay Kit.
         According to the manufacturer's protocol, the tumor samples were homogenized, and
         the supernatant were collected and determined protein concentration. Then, the supernatant
         were respectively incubated with Ac-DEVD-pNA (Caspase-3), Ac-IETD-pNA (Caspase-8)
         and Ac-LEHD-pNA (Caspase-9) in assay buffer at 37°C for 2 hours. Finally, the production
         of p-nitroaniline was monitored by microplate reader at wavelength of 405 nm.
      
      Senescence β-galactosidase staining
      Senescent cells in tumor samples were identified by Senescence β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal)
         staining was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Images were captured
         by Olympus microscope at ×200 magnification and analyzed by Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software.
      
      Immunohistochemistry
      The paraffin-embedded tumor tissues were sectioned (5 μm), deparaffinized, blocked
         with 3% hydrogen peroxide and washed with PBS. For immunostaining, sections were probed
         with antibodies against cleaved PARP (1:100), XIAP (1:200), Survivin (1:200), p21
         (1:200), p16 (1:200), pRB (1:200), CD31 (1:100), and VEGF (1:100) at 4°C overnight,
         followed by incubation with secondary antibody and visualized using 3,3-diaminobenzidine
         as chromagen. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted with glass
         coverslips. Images were captured by the Olympus microscope, and analyzed by Image-Pro
         Plus 6.0 software.
      
      Western blot
      Western blots were performed as described previously [9]. Briefly, after three weeks treatment, CT26 carcinomas (3 tumors/group) were collected,
         lysed, combined and subjected to 8–10% SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose
         membrane (Amersham). The transferred membrane were blocked with 5% non-fat milk, washed,
         and probed with antibodies against cleaved PARP (1:1000), XIAP (1:1000), Survivin
         (1:1000), p16 (1:1000), p21 (1:1000), pRB (1:1000), VEGF (1:500) or GAPDH (1:2000).
         Blots were then washed and incubated with IRDye 700- conjugated (1:3000) or IRDye
         800-conjugated (1:5000) secondary antibodies (Rockland Immunochemicals), and visualized
         in Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences).
      
      Data analysis
      Results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and the differences between groups
         were compared by one-way ANOVA. Differences were considered significant at P&lt;0.05.
