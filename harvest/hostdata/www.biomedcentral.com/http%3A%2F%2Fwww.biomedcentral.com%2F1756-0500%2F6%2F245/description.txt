						Background

					The elucidation of the routes of transmission of a pathogen is crucial for the prevention of infectious diseases caused by bacteria that are not a resident in human tissue. The purpose of this report is to describe a case of suture-related conjunctivitis caused by  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  for which we identified the transmission route using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).

				
				
					
						Case presentation

					A 38-year-old man, who had undergone surgery for glaucoma 2 years ago previously, presented with redness, discomfort, and mucopurulent discharge in the right eye. A 9–0 silk suture had been left on the conjunctiva. A strain of  P. aeruginosa  was isolated from a culture obtained from the suture, and the patient was therefore diagnosed with suture-related conjunctivitis caused by  P. aeruginosa . The conjunctivitis was cured by the application of an antimicrobial ophthalmic solution and removal of the suture. We used PFGE to survey of the indoor and outdoor environments around the patient’s house and office in order to elucidate the route of transmission of the infection. Three strains of  P. aeruginosa  were isolated from the patient’s indoor environment, and the isolate obtained from the patient’s bathroom was identical to that from the suture.

				
				
					
						Conclusion

					The case highlights the fact that an indoor environmental strain of  P. aeruginosa  can cause ocular infections.
