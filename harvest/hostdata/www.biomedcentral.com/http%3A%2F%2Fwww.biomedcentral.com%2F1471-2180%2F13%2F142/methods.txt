      Chlamydial strains and selection for resistance
      Antibiotic resistant C. trachomatis strains J/6276rif, RC-J/6276tet-rif, F(s)/70rif, F(s)/70tet-rif L2-434ofl,DUW/3Cx ofl, L1/440/LNrif or L3/404/LNrif were generated as previously described [5]. Briefly, strains were grown in McCoy cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI)
         of 1 in media containing sub-inhibitory concentrations, equivalent to half the minimum
         inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the appropriate drug. Serial passages of these strains
         were cultured in the media containing desired antibiotics until resistant mutants
         emerged or until passage was completely negative. Some strains required several attempts
         until resistant mutants were isolated. Isolates were then cloned by a twofold limiting
         dilution method. The resulting cloned elementary bodies (EBs) were grown to high titers
         and were partially purified by centrifugation of lysates of infected cells through
         a 30% MD-Gastroview® pad (Mallinckrodt Inc. St Louis).
      
      Generation of recombinant clones for complete genome sequence analysis
      Recombinants isolated for genome analysis were generated from two sets of crosses
         (Table&nbsp;1). The first of these involved two parental strains; L2-434ofl and F(s)/70rif and the second was a three-way cross with the parental strains F(s)/70tet-rif, J/6276rif and L2-434ofl. Recombination experiments were conducted as previously described [5]. Briefly, crosses were performed in McCoy cells seeded in sets of individual shell
         vials. The monolayers were then infected with different combinations of drug-resistant
         strains each at an MOI = 2, ensuring infections of cells with both strains. Cultures
         were incubated for 48&nbsp;h post-infection in the absence of antibiotics and were then
         detached and lysed using a -80C/37C freeze-thaw cycle [5]. Potential recombinants were selected by inoculating 50&nbsp;μl of the freeze-thaw lysates
         from each shell vial onto a new shell vial monolayer and overlaying with a medium
         containing antibiotics at 1/4 the MIC for each resistant parental strain. In the case
         of the three-way cross [F(s), J, L2], three different combinations of drug were applied
         to the infected monolayers (MOI = 2). These combinations included ofloxacin/rifampicin,
         ofloxacin/tetracycline, and ofloxacin/rifampicin/tetracycline.
      
      Generation of recombinant chlamydial strains for analysis of recombination hot spots
      Multiple independent shell vials containing confluent McCoy cells were inoculated
         sequentially with ofloxacin-resistant D/UW3Cx and rifampin-resistant L1/440/LN or
         L3/404/LN strains, and incubated 48&nbsp;h in medium lacking antibiotics. Monolayers were
         lysed and used as inocula onto fresh McCoy cells at MOI = 1, and incubated in the
         presence of 4X the MIC of the drugs used for selection, rifampin and ofloxacin. These
         concentrations were previously determined to be sufficient to select for individual
         recombinant strains resistant to both drugs. Incubation of either parent in this combination
         and concentration of antibiotics at MOI = 1 never yielded a doubly resistant mutant
         parent. Chlamydial recombinants growing in this mixture of antibiotics were propagated
         and cloned by limiting dilution. Only a single recombinant progeny was collected from
         each lineage from a single original inoculated shell vial. DNA was harvested from
         these clones, and PCR primers were created that flanked regions of suspected recombination
         hotspots identified by Srinivasan and colleagues [24]. The Phusion high fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) was
         used to generate PCR products from these regions, and these were sequenced at the
         Oregon State University Center for Genomics Research and Biocomputing. Sequences were
         then examined for possible recombination by comparing informative sequence polymorphisms
         relative to each parent in the cross.
      
      Chlamydia recombinant strain genomic DNA preparation
      Recombinants were clonally isolated using limiting dilution and EB purification was
         conducted as previously described [23,40]. Purified EBs were incubated for 60&nbsp;min with 4 units/mL RQ1 DNase (Promega) followed
         by treatment with 2&nbsp;mM EGTA (RQ1 Stop solution, Promega) to inactivate the DNase.
         Elementary bodies were then suspended in Qiagen Genomic buffer B1 supplemented with
         dithiothreitol (5&nbsp;mM) and DNA was then extracted using the Qiagen Genomic Tip kit,
         (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
      
      Genome sequencing and sequence analysis
      Genomic DNA from recombinant strains was processed for Illumina-based paired-end sequencing
         using commercial DNA preparation kits (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) following the
         manufacturer’s instructions. Each recombinant genome was first assembled using the
         reference-guided assembly program Maq [41]. Appropriate parental genomes were used as references in the analyses. Regions in
         reference-guided assembled genomes where Maq could not resolve sequence were then
         compared to contiguous sequences assembled using de-novo assembly software Velvet
         [42] and a single contiguous draft sequence was produced.
      
      To confirm the clonality of the recombinant genomes, and to quality control our assembly
         process, two to four apparent crossover regions in each recombinant progeny were amplified
         by PCR and sequenced using classical Sanger sequencing. In all cases the sequenced
         amplicon contained the appropriate informative sites from each parent involved in
         the cross (not shown).
      
      Recombinant maps of each genome were produced by computationally parsing a draft genome
         against the two parents used to generate the recombinant, using the alignment program
         MAFFT with the default settings [43,44]. Any detected crossover regions were manually analyzed using MacVector sequence analysis
         software (Cary, NC). Crossover regions were defined as the intervening homologous
         sequence between two informative sites (defined as a nucleotide position that varied
         in sequence between the two parent genomes), where the informative site was the same
         as one parent at one position and the same as the second parent at an immediately
         adjacent informative site.
      
      Whole genome alignments including all recombinant strains and the 3 parental strains
         were constructed using MAFFT with default settings. Any position in this alignment
         where at least one genome had a variable base was further analyzed using the Fisher
         exact test as a metric to determine if the variable genotype could be associated with
         a given phenotype. In these analyses, a low p-value indicated an association between the base sequence and a specific parental
         phenotype or genotype. A variable genotype was considered to be associated with a
         given phenotype if the calculated p-value was the lowest possible based on the sample size. The p-values calculated by the Fisher’s exact test were inverse Log-transformed and plotted
         using the statistical analysis program R (http://www.r-project.org/).
      
      Whole genome alignments of all recombinants against both parents were used to determine
         if any random mutations had occurred during culture and the generation of recombinants.
         A random mutation was defined as a nucleotide in the recombinant sequence that was
         different than the nucleotide of either parent at the same nucleotide position. All
         ORF designations are based on numbering system used for the C. trachomatis D/UW3 genome sequence [31].
      
      Measurement of attachment efficiency
      McCoy cell monolayers were seeded in duplicate 24 well plates at 90% confluency, and
         triplicate wells of each plate were infected using a target MOI = of 1. Plates were
         then either centrifuged at 640 × g (2000 RPM on Beckman Coulter, Allegra X-15R centrifuge)
         for 1&nbsp;h or placed on a rocker platform for 1&nbsp;h, with both treatments being at room
         temperature. Wells were then washed 3 times with Hanks balanced salt solution and
         DNA was extracted directly from each well using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue
         kit, with the lysis buffer supplemented with 5&nbsp;mM dithiothreitol. Each sample was
         pipetted up and down 10 times to disrupt both host cells and chlamydiae. Genome copy
         number was determined for each treatment by qPCR, using a probe for hsp60 (groEL_3,
         CT755). A cloned and quantified version of CT755 was used as the standard curve on
         all qPCR plates, ensuring that each sample being analyzed was properly quantified.
         The target sequence for this assay is conserved among C. trachomatis, but was unique to this hsp60 allele, as demonstrated by PCR analysis of alternate
         hsp60 open reading frames (CT110 and CT604; not shown). Attachment efficiency was
         then calculated by dividing the genome copy number of the rocked samples by the genome
         copy number of the centrifuged samples.
      
      Quantification of secondary inclusion formation
      The frequency of secondary inclusion formation in parental and progeny strains was
         determined using previously described methods [23]. Briefly, McCoy cells were infected with the strain of interest at an MOI = of 0.3.
         These cells were incubated for approximately 24 hpi prior to fixation with methanol.
         C. trachomatis IncA was labeled with mouse monoclonal anti-IncA, and chlamydial developmental forms
         were labeled with mouse anti-lipopolysaccharide [23]. Cells were then labeled with appropriate secondary antibodies (Southern Biotechnology
         Associates, Birmingham, AL) and observed using 400× or 1000× magnification. A semi-quantitative
         measure of secondary inclusion formation was conducted by determining the fraction
         of infected cells having secondary inclusions versus the total number of infected
         cells. A 1+ to 4+ scoring system was used to quantify secondary inclusion formation
         and each score was determined on three independent sets of coverslips. A 1+ value
         is equivalent to less than 10% of infected cells having secondary inclusions, while
         a 4+ value is equivalent to 40% or more of the cells having secondary inclusions.
