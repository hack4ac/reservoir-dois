						Background

					Honey has been identified as a potential alternative to the widespread use of antibiotics, which are of significant concern considering the emergence of resistant bacteria. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of honey samples produced by a stingless bee species and by  Apis  sp. against pathogenic bacteria, as well as to identify the presence of phenolic compounds.

				
				
					
						Methods

					Honey samples from the stingless bee  M. compressipes manaosensis  were collected twice, during the dry and rainy seasons. Three commercial honey samples from  Apis  sp. were also included in this study. Two different assays were performed to evaluate the antibacterial potential of the honey samples: agar-well diffusion and broth macrodilution. Liquid-liquid extraction was used to assess phenolic compounds from honey. HPLC analysis was performed in order to identify rutin and apigenin on honey samples. Chromatograms were recorded at 340 and 290Â nm.

				
				
					
						Results

					Two honey samples were identified as having the highest antimicrobial activity using the agar diffusion method. Honey produced by  Melipona compressipes manaosensis  inhibited the growth of  Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli  (0157: H7),  Proteus vulgaris, Shigella sonnei and Klebsiella  sp .  A sample of honey produced by  Apis  sp. also inhibited the growth of  Salmonella paratyphi . The macrodilution technique presented greater sensitivity for the antibacterial testing, since all honey samples showed activity. Flavonoid rutin was identified in the honey sample produced by the stingless bee.

				
				
					
						Conclusions

					Honey samples tested in this work showed antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The results reported herein highlight the potential of using honey to control bacterial growth.
