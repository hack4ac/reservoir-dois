            Glucocorticoid use in sepsis is controversial. In contrast to other extracellular signaling molecules, glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) are intra-cytoplasmic. Several GR isoforms have been identified. A study in  Critical Care Forum suggests that sepsis alters the abundance of the dominant negative GRÎ². Here we discuss GR isoforms and how they may affect cellular responses to glucocorticoids in sepsis.
