Abstract
Suppose  p 
 ( 
 z 
 ) 
  is a holomorphic function, the multiplicity of its zeros is at most  d ,  P 
 ( 
 z 
 ) 
  is a nonconstant polynomial. Let ℱ be a family of meromorphic functions in a domain  D , all of whose zeros and poles have multiplicity at least  max 
 { 
 
    k 
    2 
 
 + 
 d 
 + 
 1 
 , 
 k 
 + 
 d 
 } 
 . If for each pair of functions  f  and  g  in ℱ,  P 
 ( 
 f 
 ) 
 
    f 
    
       ( 
       k 
       ) 
 
 
  and  P 
 ( 
 g 
 ) 
 
    g 
    
       ( 
       k 
       ) 
 
 
  share a holomorphic function  p  (  z  ) , then ℱ is normal in  D . It generalizes and extends the results of Jiang, Gao and Wu, Xu.
