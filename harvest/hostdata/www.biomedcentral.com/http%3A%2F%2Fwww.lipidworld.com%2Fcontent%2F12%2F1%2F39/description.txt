						Background

					The development of osteoporosis is associated with several risk factors, such as genetic polymorphisms and enviromental factors. This study assessed the correlation between SAA1 gene rs12218 polymorphism and HDL-C lelvels and osteoporosis in a population of Chinese women.

				
				
					
						Methods

					A total of 387 postmenopausal female patients who were diagnosed with osteoporosis (case group) based on bone mineral density measurements via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and 307 females with no osteoporosis (control group) were included in this study. Correlations between SAA1 gene rs12218 polymorphism and osteoporosis and HDL-C level were investigated through the identification of SAA1 gene rs12218 polymorphism genotypes using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).

				
				
					
						Results

					The TT genotype of rs12218 was more frequently in osteoporosis patients than in control subjects (P <0.001). And the rs12218 was found to be associated with plasma TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, and BMD levels in osteoporosis patients (P<0.05).

				
				
					
						Conclusions

					The present results indicate that both osteoporosis and lipids levels are associated with the TT genotype of rs12218 in the human SAA1 gene.
